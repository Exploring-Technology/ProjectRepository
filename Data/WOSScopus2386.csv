1,Scopus,Monisha et al. (2023),2023,Judd-Ofelt analysis and luminescence characteristics of Eu3+ doped Nepheline (NaAlSiO4)-based glass ceramics for solid-state lighting applications,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,"The present work addresses on the optical and spectroscopic properties of glass ceramics containing a hexagonal NaAlSiO4 crystalline phase (Nepheline) and Eu3+ dopant, prepared by melt-quenching technique followed by subsequent heat treatment. The precipitation of NaAlSiO4 crystals in the glass system with increasing heating temperature was determined by XRD analysis. The existing vibrational bands such as BO3, BO4, SiO2 and O-H groups in the glass network and the increase in the amount of non-bridging oxygens with increasing heating temperature of the precursor glasses were evaluated through FTIR spectroscopy. Morphological changes in the glass surface induced with the growth of NaAlSiO4 crystals is recorded by field emission scanning electron microscopy at resolutions of 1 µm and 200 nm. The impact of heating temperature and Eu3+ ions embedded in the NaAlSiO4 crystalline phase on the optical properties was studied using absorption spectra, excitation, emission spectra, and decay curves. The glass ceramics exhibited a decrease in their bandgap energy values and an increase in their Urbach energy values with heat treatment at higher temperatures. The Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters evaluated from the emission spectra showed the trend Ω2 &gt; Ω4. The emission bands with intense electric dipole transition 5D0→7F2, long decay lifetimes, and improved quantum efficiency of Eu3+ ions evidenced the partitioning of Eu3+ ions into the NaAlSiO4 crystalline phase. Radiative calculations from the emission spectra showed a higher stimulated emission cross-section for glass ceramics. The CIE-1931 color coordinates, correlated color temperature (CCT, K), and color purity measurements favoured red emission from Eu3+ ions with better quality. Therefore, the prepared glass ceramics can favour the need for LED applications and laser devices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121971,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140330346&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnoncrysol.2022.121971&partnerID=40&md5=033776ef57ea40cade689431a0b08452,Article
2,Scopus,Seskir et al. (2022),2022,The landscape of the quantum start-up ecosystem,EPJ Quantum Technology,"The second quantum revolution has been producing groundbreaking scientific and technological outputs since the early 2000s; however, the scientific literature on the impact of this revolution on the industry, specifically on start-ups, is limited. In this paper, we present a landscaping study with a gathered dataset of 441 companies from 42 countries that we identify as quantum start-ups, meaning that they mainly focus on quantum technologies (QT) as their primary priority business. We answer the following questions: (1) What are the temporal and geographical distributions of the quantum start-ups? (2) How can we categorize them, and how are these categories populated? (3) Are there any patterns that we can derive from empirical data on trends? We found that more than 92% of these companies have been founded within the last 10 years, and more than 50% of them are located in the US, the UK, and Canada. We categorized the QT start-ups into six fields: (i) complementary technologies, (ii) quantum computing (hardware), (iii) quantum computing (software/application/simulation), (iv) quantum cryptography/communication, (v) quantum sensing and metrology, and (vi) supporting companies, and analyzed the population of each field both for countries, and temporally. Finally, we argue that low levels of quantum start-up activity in a country might be an indicator of a national initiative to be adopted afterwards, which later sees both an increase in the number of start-ups, and a diversification of activity in different QT fields. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1140/epjqt/s40507-022-00146-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140618646&doi=10.1140%2fepjqt%2fs40507-022-00146-x&partnerID=40&md5=674b162a227c6b296489c852c29d78c4,Article

Moreover, the abstraction of tasks and services offered by the quantum network should enable platform-independent applications to be executed without the knowledge of the underlying physical implementation. Here we experimentally demonstrate, using remote solid-state quantum network nodes, a link layer, and a physical layer protocol for entanglement-based quantum networks. The link layer abstracts the physical-layer entanglement attempts into a robust, platform-independent entanglement delivery service. The system is used to run full state tomography of the delivered entangled states, as well as preparation of a remote qubit state on a server by its client.

4,Scopus,Kuang & Perepechaenko (2022),2022,Quantum encryption with quantum permutation pad in IBMQ systems,EPJ Quantum Technology,"Quantum permutation pad or QPP is a quantum-safe symmetric cryptographic algorithm proposed by Kuang and Bettenburg in 2020. The theoretical foundation of QPP leverages the linear algebraic representations of quantum gates which makes QPP realizable in both, quantum and classical systems. By applying the QPP with 64 of 8-bit permutation gates, holding respective entropy of over 100,000 bits, we accomplished quantum random number distributions digitally over today’s classical internet. The QPP has also been used to create pseudo quantum random numbers and served as a foundation for quantum-safe lightweight block and streaming ciphers. This paper continues to explore numerous applications of QPP, namely, we present an implementation of QPP as a quantum encryption circuit on today’s still noisy quantum computers. With the publicly available 5-qubit IBMQ devices, we demonstrate quantum secure encryption (256 bits of entropy) using 2-qubit QPP with 56 permutation gates, and 3-qubit QPP with 17 permutation gates respectively. Initial qubits of the encryption circuit correspond to the plaintext and after applying quantum encryption operations, cipher qubits are measured with probabilistic distributions, and the results with the highest probability are recorded as cipher bits. The cipher bits are then decrypted with an inverse QPP circuit. The output state plaintext qubits are measured and the most frequent count measurement results are recorded as plaintext bits. This quantum encryption and decryption process clearly demonstrates that QPP quantum implementations works exactly as symmetric encryption and decryption schemes should. The plaintext and ciphertext bits can also be encrypted and decrypted respectively by any classical computing device with the corresponding QPP algorithm as in quantum computers. This work reveals that it is possible to build quantum-secure communications between quantum-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical computers over today’s internet and the future quantum internet. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1140/epjqt/s40507-022-00145-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139781732&doi=10.1140%2fepjqt%2fs40507-022-00145-y&partnerID=40&md5=a0513315528229cc0f29c1c5fe6fc01d,Article

(2022),2022,Application of artificial neural networks for the prediction of performance and exhaust emissions in IC engine using biodiesel-diesel blends containing quantum dot based on carbon doped,Energy Conversion and Management: X,"The application of the fossil diesel in engines is detrimental to the humans as they pollute the environment. Currently, all-embracing research is in progression to discover an alternative fuel and improve its quality. The nanoparticles are one of the current technologies that is beneficial for upgrading the fuel properties. Among nanoparticles, GQD stands out and offers a plethora of technical advantages for future uses as an additive to reduce emission profiles. The suitability of newly created additives, such as GQD, to improve the characteristics of IC engines driven by alternative fuels was highlighted. GQD, as a novel and intriguing zero-dimensional material of the carbon family, has been actively researched in order to generate inexpensive and environmentally friendly materials. There is a dearth of orderly investigations ANN generated modeling of diesel engine's efficacy of IC engines fueled with ternary blends of GQD, waste fish oil biodiesel (WOFB), and diesel fuel in the existing works. The correlation between engine speed (1800, 2100, and 2400 rpm), GQD+ethanol blend (2-8 vol. conc.), and WFOB and diesel fuel mixture and engine performance indicators (power, torque, braking specific fuel consumption) and emission characteristics (CO, CO2, UHC, NOx) was modelled using ANN. Finally, the results showed that adding GQD+E to 10%WOFB increases braking power and engine torque, with B10 + E6 + GQD45 fuel having the maximum brake power and engine torque. The average difference in braking power and engine torque between the B10 + E6 + GQD45 gasoline and the D100 is 13.84% and 16.95%, respectively. Adding GQD+E to 10% WOFB also lowered BSFC, UHC, CO, and NO emissions, with B10 + E6 + GQD45 fuel having the lowest UHC and CO emissions.In comparison to D100, UHC, CO, and CO2 dropped by 21.70, 24.67, and 26.38%, respectively. As a result, adding GQD+E to 10% WOFB increases engine performance while lowering emissions. Also, the results for ANN showed that, both Pearson's correlation coefficient (0.96, 0.71, 0.95, 0.92, 0.84 and 0.91 for CO2, NO, UHC, BSFC, brake power and engine torque, respectively) and RMSE (0.0295, 0.0227, 1.6545, 1.5046, 11.2515, 0.1557 and 0.3913 for CO2, NO, UHC, BSFC, brake power and engine torque respectively) for either parameter traits show the efficacy of ANN as observed from the predicted values being close to the experimental values. © 2022 The Authors",,10.1016/j.ecmx.2022.100304,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139316456&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecmx.2022.100304&partnerID=40&md5=7d55e329362fe2a129cfd75b58bc4cf3,Article

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed.

Although recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of satellite-to-ground QKD links, the underlying statistical characteristics of quantum atmospheric channels have not been well-understood and experimentally verified in the literature. In this paper, we highlight that classical atmospheric statistical models can be applied for describing random fluctuations of the quantum channels. To verify this fact, we report a statistical verification study of quantum atmospheric channels from the world’s first low-Earth orbit (LEO) 50-kg-class microsatellite-to-ground quantum-limited communication experiment. The verified statistical model is then applied to numerically investigate the quantum bit-error rate (QBER) and secret-key length (SKL) of a decoy-state efficient Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) QKD protocol with optimized parameters considering finite-key effects, implemented over a LEO 6-unit (6U)-CubeSat-to-ground link. Important insights of the physical channel effects including pointing errors and atmospheric turbulence on the QBER and SKL are then revealed.

(2022),2022,Enhancing quantum cryptography with quantum dot single-photon sources,npj Quantum Information,"Quantum cryptography harnesses quantum light, in particular single photons, to provide security guarantees that cannot be reached by classical means. For each cryptographic task, the security feature of interest is directly related to the photons’ non-classical properties. Quantum dot-based single-photon sources are remarkable candidates, as they can in principle emit deterministically, with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here, we show that these sources provide additional security benefits, thanks to the tunability of coherence in the emitted photon-number states. We identify the optimal optical pumping scheme for the main quantum-cryptographic primitives, and benchmark their performance with respect to Poisson-distributed sources such as attenuated laser states and down-conversion sources. In particular, we elaborate on the advantage of using phonon-assisted and two-photon excitation rather than resonant excitation for quantum key distribution and other primitives. The presented results will guide future developments in solid-state and quantum information science for photon sources that are tailored to quantum communication tasks. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41534-022-00626-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137786480&doi=10.1038%2fs41534-022-00626-z&partnerID=40&md5=08c1c4ace6f53c97425fb71c21e1ba21,Article

(2022),2022,Multi-dimensional disturbance secure communication system with dynamic key hiding transmission based on power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access,Optics Communications,"Data security is becoming more critical in networks as high-speed and large-capacity optical transmission becomes more common. Cryptographic protocols at the MAC layer and higher tiers of the protocol stack are under threat as a result of quantum computer developments. Optical physical layer encryption has great advantages in optical communication security transmission, which can be compatible with a variety of networks, and achieve an efficient and secured ultra-high high-speed data transmission. In this work, we propose a physical layer encryption scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (OFDM-PD-NOMA) technique for the dynamic key hiding transmission and multi-dimensional disturbance. The encryption scheme realizes multi-point mutual-coupling key transmission and multi-dimensional disturbance encryption by a 3D discrete chaotic model. The encrypted data and the dynamic key are transmitted together by multichannel signals in PD-NOMA, then, the chaotic signal generated by chaotic generator is used to mask the dynamic key. 3D chaotic sequences generated by the dynamic key are used to encrypt bits, symbols and carriers of the original signal. The initial key, the dynamic key and the chaotic signal realize multi-point mutual-coupling. We conduct a 74.6 Gb/s encrypted quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)-OFDM-PD-NOMA signal transmission over 2 km 7 core fiber. The key space of encrypted scheme can reach 10462. Finally, experimental results show that the original data can be recovered accurately, and the bit error rate (BER) of the dynamic key is close to zero.

However, the secret key rates of the reported CVQKD systems are only a few Mbps over typical transmission distance so far. Here, we address the fundamental experimental problems and demonstrate a single-carrier four-state CVQKD with sub-Gbps key rate within metropolitan area. In the demonstrated four-state CVQKD using local local oscillator, an ultra-low level of excess noise is obtained and a high efficient post-processing setup is designed for practically extracting the final secure keys. Thus, the achieved secret key rates are 190.54 Mbps, 137.76 Mbps and 52.48 Mbps using linear channel assuming security analysis method and 233.87 Mbps, 133.6 Mbps and 21.53 Mbps using semidefinite programming security analysis method over transmission distances of 5 km, 10 km and 25 km, respectively. This result increases the asymptotic secret key rate to sub-Gbps level, which is sufficient to achieve the one-time pad cryptographic task.

(2022),2022,High resolution multispectral spatial light modulators based on tunable Fabry-Perot nanocavities,Light: Science and Applications,"Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are the most relevant technology for dynamic wavefront manipulation. They find diverse applications ranging from novel displays to optical and quantum communications. Among commercial SLMs for phase modulation, Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) offers the smallest pixel size and, thus, the most precise phase mapping and largest field of view (FOV). Further pixel miniaturization, however, is not possible in these devices due to inter-pixel cross-talks, which follow from the high driving voltages needed to modulate the thick liquid crystal (LC) cells that are necessary for full phase control. Newly introduced metasurface-based SLMs provide means for pixel miniaturization by modulating the phase via resonance tuning. These devices, however, are intrinsically monochromatic, limiting their use in applications requiring multi-wavelength operation. Here, we introduce a novel design allowing small pixel and multi-spectral operation. Based on LC-tunable Fabry-Perot nanocavities engineered to support multiple resonances across the visible range (including red, green and blue wavelengths), our design provides continuous 2π phase modulation with high reflectance at each of the operating wavelengths. Experimentally, we realize a device with 96 pixels (~1 μm pitch) that can be individually addressed by electrical biases. Using it, we first demonstrate multi-spectral programmable beam steering with FOV~18° and absolute efficiencies exceeding 40%.

(2022),2022,Cooperative light-induced breathing of soft porous crystals via azobenzene buckling,Nature Communications,"Although light is a prominent stimulus for smart materials, the application of photoswitches as light-responsive triggers for phase transitions of porous materials remains poorly explored. Here we incorporate an azobenzene photoswitch in the backbone of a metal-organic framework producing light-induced structural contraction of the porous network in parallel to gas adsorption. Light-stimulation enables non-invasive spatiotemporal control over the mechanical properties of the framework, which ultimately leads to pore contraction and subsequent guest release via negative gas adsorption. The complex mechanism of light-gated breathing is established by a series of in situ diffraction and spectroscopic experiments, supported by quantum mechanical and molecular dynamic simulations. Unexpectedly, this study identifies a novel light-induced deformation mechanism of constrained azobenzene photoswitches relevant to the future design of light-responsive materials. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41467-022-29149-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128132775&doi=10.1038%2fs41467-022-29149-z&partnerID=40&md5=470c29a5efda0cd851174919eafb3b7b,Article

For practical application, it is important to improve the performances, such as the secure information rate and the communication distance. In this paper, we report an elaborate physical system design and protocol with much enhanced performance. This design increased the secrecy capacity greatly by achieving an ultra-low quantum bit error rate of <0.1%, one order of magnitude smaller than that of existing systems. Compared to previous systems, the proposed scheme uses photonic time-bin and phase states, operating at 50 MHz of repetition rate, which can be easily upgraded to over 1 GHz using current on-the-shelf technology. The results of our experimentation demonstrate that the proposed system can tolerate more channel loss, from 5.1 dB, which is about 28.3 km in fiber in the previous scheme, to 18.4 dB, which corresponds to fiber length of 102.2 km. Thus, the experiment shows that intercity quantum secure direct communication through fiber is feasible with present-day technology. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41377-022-00769-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127962159&doi=10.1038%2fs41377-022-00769-w&partnerID=40&md5=a7d1753b157c01d60785c52b4b9db114,Article

The microwave range shows relevant advantages with respect to other frequencies in open-air transmission, such as low absorption losses and low-energy consumption, and in addition, it is the natural working frequency in superconducting quantum technologies. Entanglement distribution between separate parties is at the core of secure quantum communications. Therefore, understanding its limitations in realistic open-air settings, especially in the rather unexplored microwave regime, is crucial for transforming microwave quantum communications into a mainstream technology. Here, we investigate the feasibility of an open-air entanglement distribution scheme with microwave two-mode squeezed states. First, we study the reach of direct entanglement transmission in open air, obtaining a maximum distance of approximately 500 m with parameters feasible for state-of-the-art experiments. Subsequently, we adapt entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping protocols to microwave technology in order to reduce the environment-induced entanglement degradation. The employed entanglement distillation helps to increase quantum correlations in the short-distance low-squeezing regime by up to 46%, and the reach of entanglement increases by 14% with entanglement swapping. Importantly, we compute the fidelity of a continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol using open-air-distributed entanglement as a resource.

The IoT provides the connected devices with a variety of resources that enable effective communication. At this point, several security issues arise to get the sensitive information behind every communication in the IoT. To provide users with security and privacy, cryptographic schemes are adopted, the most popular being public key cryptographic systems (PKC). However, with the advent of quantum computing, the level of security that can be provided by the PKC schemes is a big question. Another important issue is that the IoT environment is resource-constrained, which necessitates the implementation of lightweight cryptographic algorithms for better security. In response to these issues, the post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes are one of the significant developments contributing to IoT security in the post-quantum world. This article examines the key security issues in the IoT environment and examines the effective solutions found in the literature. The problems in IoT in the quantum era are discussed and appropriate solutions by PKC schemes under limited resources in IoT are focused.

The results derived from these experiments show that NTRU is suitable for modern microcontrollers targeting wireless sensor networks design, while old devices present in popular platforms might not afford the cost of its implementation. © 2014 IEEE.",,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3162254,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127535578&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3162254&partnerID=40&md5=b39ab6616fdcdf0ddeb327e5ac6b8b8d,Article

(2022),2022,Scheme for implementing nonlocal high-fidelity quantum controlled-not gates on quantum-dot-confined electron spins using optical microcavities and photonic hyperentanglement,Frontiers in Physics,"Quantum information networks can transmit quantum states and perform quantum operations between different quantum network nodes, which are essential for various applications of quantum information technology in the future. In this paper, a potentially practical scheme for implementing nonlocal quantum controlled-not (CNOT) gate operations on quantum-dot-confined electron spins between two quantum network nodes is presented. The scheme can realize parallel teleportation of two nonlocal quantum CNOT gates simultaneously by employing hyperentangled photon pairs to establish quantum channel, which can effectively improve the channel capacity and operational speed. The core of the scheme are two kinds of photon-spin hybrid quantum CNOT gate working in a failure-heralded and fidelity-robust fashion. With the heralded mechanism, the nonlocal CNOT gates can be implementated with unity fidelities in principle, even if the particularly ideal conditions commonly used in other schemes are not satisfied strictly. Our analysis and calculations indicate that the scheme can be demonstrated efficiently (with efficiency exceeding 99%) with current or near-future technologies. Moreover, the utilized photon-spin hybrid quantum gates can be regarded as universal modules for many other quantum information processing (QIP) tasks. Therefore, the scheme is potential for constructing elementary quantum networks, and realizing nolocal QIP with high channel capacities, high fidelities, and high efficiencies.

However, the development of high-efficiency and wavelength-tunable NIR nanomaterials is still a challenge. Herein, a series of lanthanide ions doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 double perovskite nanocrystals (DPNCs) with wavelength-tunable NIR light emission (800-1600 nm) have been synthesized. The optimal photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the DPNCs reaches 66.7%, which is a record value for DPNCs. It is mainly attributed to the contribution of NIR emission of lanthanide ions doped into DPNCs. More importantly, the series of NIR emission wavelengths of lanthanide ions doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 DPNCs include not only shorter-wavelength NIR light (≤900 nm) but also longer-wavelength NIR light (>900 nm), which are more appropriate for foodstuff analysis and medical diagnosis applications. Furthermore, 11.2% Nd3+ doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 DPNCs with the optimal PLQY were embedded in a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer matrix (DPNCs@PMMA), and the stability of DPNCs modified by PMMA has been greatly improved. Finally, the 11.2% Nd3+ ions doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 DPNCs@PMMA based NIR LEDs have demonstrated good night vision and human tissue penetration.

(2022),2022,Multiparticle quantum walk–based error correction algorithm with two-lattice Bose–Hubbard model,Frontiers in Physics,"When the evolution of discrete time quantum walk is carried out for particles, the ramble state is prone to error due to the influence of system noise. A multiparticle quantum walk error correction algorithm based on the two-lattice Bose–Hubbard model is proposed in this study. First, two point Bose–Hubbard models are constructed according to the local Euclidean generator, and it is proved that the two elements in the model can be replaced arbitrarily. Second, the relationship between the transition intensity and entanglement degree of the particles in the model is obtained by using the Bethe hypothesis method. Third, the position of the quantum lattice is coded and the quantum state exchange gate is constructed. Finally, the state replacement of quantum walk on the lattice point is carried out by switching the walker to the lattice point of quantum error correction code, and the replacement is carried out again. The entanglement of quantum particles in the double-lattice Bose–Hubbard model is simulated numerically. When the ratio of the interaction between particles and the transition intensity of particles is close to 0, the entanglement operation of quantum particles in the model can be realized by using this algorithm. According to the properties of the Bose–Hubbard model, quantum walking error correction can be realized after particle entanglement. This study introduces the popular restnet network as a training model, which increases the decoding speed of the error correction circuit by about 33%. More importantly, the lower threshold limit of the convolutional neural network (CNN) decoder is increased from 0.0058 under the traditional minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) to 0.0085, which realizes the stable progress of quantum walk with high fault tolerance rate.

Herein, we provide an overview of the element of computational inverse molecular design and offer our views on current limitations and outstanding challenges.

41,Scopus,Yang et al. (2022),2022,Construction of a Deep Neural Network Energy Function for Protein Physics,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,"The traditional approach of computational biology consists of calculating molecule properties by using approximate classical potentials. Interactions between atoms are described by an energy function derived from physical principles or fitted to experimental data. Their functional form is usually limited to pairwise interactions between atoms and does not consider complex multibody effects. More recently, neural networks have emerged as an alternative way of describing the interactions between biomolecules. In this approach, the energy function does not have an explicit functional form and is learned bottom-up from simulations at the atomistic or quantum level. In this study, we attempt a top-down approach and use deep learning methods to obtain an energy function by exploiting the large amount of experimental data acquired with years in the field of structural biology. The energy function is represented by a probability density model learned from a large repertoire of building blocks representing local clusters of amino acids paired with their sequence signature. We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by generating a neural network energy function and testing its validity on several applications such as discriminating decoys, assessing qualities of structural models, sampling structural conformations, and designing new protein sequences. We foresee that, in the future, our methodology could exploit the continuously increasing availability of experimental data and simulations and provide a new method for the parametrization of protein energy functions. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work provides an initial step toward this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory of near-term quantum networks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we show that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical framework to model protocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific implementation platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links introduced in prior work and by providing new results on policies for elementary links in the steady-state (infinite-time) limit. Then, we show how the elementary link MDP can be used to analyze a complete quantum network protocol. We then provide an extension of the MDP formalism to two elementary links.

(2022),2022,Efficient scheme for preparing hybrid GHZ entangled states with multiple types of photonic qubits in circuit QED,European Physical Journal Plus,"Hybrid entangled states are of fundamental interest in quantum physics and have significant applications in hybrid quantum communication and quantum computation. A great amount of work has been devoted to creating hybrid entangled states using two kinds of quantum systems or two types of qubits. Attention has been recently shifted to preparing hybrid entangled states with three kinds of quantum systems or three types of qubit encodings. Using three cavities coupled to a superconducting qutrit (i.e., a three-level quantum system), here we present a scheme to prepare a hybrid tripartite Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state with three types of photonic qubits, each type containing one photonic qubit. By using a superconducting qutrit to couple three groups of cavities, we further show that the scheme can be generalized to create a hybrid multipartite GHZ entangled state with three types of photonic qubits, each type containing multiple photonic qubits. This scheme has the following features and advantages. The GHZ state preparation requires only a single step of operation. The hardware resources are greatly reduced since only one qutrit is needed to couple all cavities. The GHZ state is deterministically created because no measurement is required. The operational time required for the GHZ state preparation does not increase with the number of qubits. Moreover, during the GHZ state preparation, the coupler qutrit stays in the ground state and thus decoherence from the coupler qutrit is significantly suppressed. As an example, we further discuss the experimental feasibility of creating a hybrid tripartite GHZ state with three types of photonic qubits, each type containing one photonic qubit. This proposal is universal and can be extended to create the proposed hybrid GHZ state in a wide range of physical system, which consists of microwave or optical cavities coupled to a qutrit such as a three-level natural or artificial atom. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-03251-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139214126&doi=10.1140%2fepjp%2fs13360-022-03251-z&partnerID=40&md5=ca34df035d180273a13bf9bba3ab4c9c,Article

Although the perfect vortex beam (PVB) based on traditional methods can solve this problem, they are usually bulky and unstable.

The former regulates the propagation phase by using isotropic unit cells; the latter simultaneously manipulates the propagation and geometric phase to achieve the spin-decoupled phase control by arranging anisotropic unit cells. In addition, we also demonstrate the stable generation of a perfect Poincaré beam with arbitrary polarization and phase distribution on a hybrid-order Poincaré Sphere via a spin-decoupled metasurface, which is achieved by the linear superposition of two PVBs with orthogonal circular polarizations.

49,Scopus,Wang (2022),2022,A prototype of quantum von Neumann architecture,Communications in Theoretical Physics,"A modern computer system, based on the von Neumann architecture, is a complicated system with several interactive modular parts. It requires a thorough understanding of the physics of information storage, processing, protection, readout, etc. Quantum computing, as the most generic usage of quantum information, follows a hybrid architecture so far, namely, quantum algorithms are stored and controlled classically, and mainly the executions of them are quantum, leading to the so-called quantum processing units. Such a quantum-classical hybrid is constrained by its classical ingredients, and cannot reveal the computational power of a fully quantum computer system as conceived from the beginning of the field. Recently, the nature of quantum information has been further recognized, such as the no-programming and no-control theorems, and the unifying understandings of quantum algorithms and computing models. As a result, in this work, we propose a model of a universal quantum computer system, the quantum version of the von Neumann architecture. It uses ebits (i.e. Bell states) as elements of the quantum memory unit, and qubits as elements of the quantum control unit and processing unit. As a digital quantum system, its global configurations can be viewed as tensor-network states. Its universality is proved by the capability to execute quantum algorithms based on a program composition scheme via a universal quantum gate teleportation. It is also protected by the uncertainty principle, the fundamental law of quantum information, making it quantum-secure and distinct from the classical case. In particular, we introduce a few variants of quantum circuits, including the tailed, nested, and topological ones, to characterize the roles of quantum memory and control, which could also be of independent interest in other contexts.

Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) are employed to learn the CQT protocols on account of different training scenarios with controls of gate parameters among shared entangled states, measurement, and recovery operations. Numerical results show the CQT protocols can be discovered with unit fidelity regardless of ideal or nonideal channels by training the PQCs with hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) optimization under full cooperations of the participants. Further, the influence of quantum channel noise on the teleportation performance is explored by parameterizing the entangled states with noise and entanglement parameters under adjustable recovery operations. Simulation results indicate the trained PQC can improve the system performance, which implies the potential denoising capability of the HQC algorithms.

52,Scopus,Tian et al. (2022),2022,Quantum cascade laser imaging (LDIR) and machine learning for the identification of environmentally exposed microplastics and polymers,Environmental Research,"Monitoring of microplastics in environmental samples is relevant to the scientific world, as well as to environmental agencies and water authorities, in particular considering increasing efforts to decrease emissions and the growing concern of governments and the public. Therefore, rapid accurate detection and identification of microplastics including polymers, despite their degradation in the environment, is crucial. The degradation has a significant impact on the infrared spectra of the microplastics and can impede the identification process. This work presents a novel approach to addressing the problem of identification of weathered microplastics. A quantum cascade laser (LDIR) was used to record the infrared spectra of various polymeric particles (81,291 individual particles). Using a combination of pristine and weathered particles, two supervised machine learning (ML) models, namely Subspace k-Nearest Neighbor (Sub-kNN) and Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), were trained to recognize the spectrum characteristics of labeled particles and then used to identify unlabeled samples, with an identification accuracy of 89.7% and 77.1% using 10-fold cross validation. About 90% of the samples could be identified via the Sub-kNN or BDT models. Subsequently, a non-supervised ML model, namely, Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), was used to cluster samples which could not be labeled from the supervised ML model. This enabled the detection of additional subgroups of microplastics. Manual labelling can then be carried out on a selection of spectra per group (e.g., centroids of each cluster), hence accelerating the identification process and allowing to add new labeled samples to the initial supervised ML. Although expert efforts are still needed, the proposed method greatly lowers labeling efforts by using the combined supervised and unsupervised learning models. In the future, the use of deep neural networks could further boost the implementation of these kinds of approaches for polymer and microplastic identification in environmental settings. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.envres.2022.113569,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131368729&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2022.113569&partnerID=40&md5=66836eaf3fee942628baa5528267d28e,Article

In cyber-physical systems, cloud storage utilizes data deduplication techniques to improve the performance of its applications. However, this method exposes sensitive data and causes security risks. Various research related to cloud storage has been conducted. Despite the advantages of this technology, it lacks the necessary security features and high performance. In the proposed method, a victim's virtual computer is moved to the cloud without interfering with the other processes running on the network. It protects against the attacks caused by encrypting the data with a cryptographically binding hash. Post-Quantum Cryptographic techniques, such as lightweight Multi-Extractable Somewhere Statistically Binding and Learning With Error authenticate data sharing protocols (MESSB–LWE), have been used. These allow for safe data sharing across geographically scattered physical devices and clients with lightweight concepts. The numerical analysis of MESSB–LWE is carried out in different stages, and the results show that it has incredible performance and practicality when compared to the literature.

As of 2020 we appear to have achieved 'quantum supremacy', that is, a quantum computer that performs a given task faster than its classical counterpart. This paper examines some possibilities opened up by potential future application of quantum computing to transportation simulation and planning. To date, no such research was found to exist, therefore we begin with an introduction to quantum computing for the programmers of transport models. We discuss existing quantum computing research relevant to transportation, finding developments in network analysis, shortest path computation, multi-objective routing, optimization and calibration - of which the latter three appear to offer the greater promise in future research. Two examples are developed in greater detail, (1) an application of Grover's quantum algorithm for extracting the mean, which has general applicability towards summarizing distributions which are expensive to compute classically, is applied to an assignment or betweenness model - quantum speedup is elusive in the general case but achievable when trading speed for accuracy for limited outputs; (2) quantum optimization is applied to an activity-based model, giving a theoretically quadratic speedup. Recent developments notwithstanding, implementation of quantum transportation algorithms will for the foreseeable future remain a challenge due to space overheads imposed by the requirement for reversible computation. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",,10.1109/TITS.2021.3132161,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121838743&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3132161&partnerID=40&md5=5b2794f0f060a22b537e38d63e6fdc8d,Article

Traditionally, this trend has been primarily seen as a serious risk for cryptography; however, a positive aspect of quantum technology should also be stressed. In this regard, viewing this technology as a resource for honest parties rather than adversaries, it may enhance not only the security, but also the performance of specific cryptographic schemes. While considerable effort has been devoted to the design of quantum-resistant and quantum-enhanced schemes, little effort has been made to understanding their physical security. Physical security deals with the design and implementation of security measures fulfilling the practical requirements of cryptographic primitives, which are equally essential for classic and quantum ones. This survey aims to draw greater attention to the importance of physical security, with a focus on secure key generation and storage as well as secure execution. More specifically, the possibility of performing side-channel analysis in the quantum world is discussed and compared to attacks launched in the classic world. Besides, proposals for quantum random number generation and quantum physically unclonable functions are compared to their classic counterparts and further analyzed to give a better understanding of their features, advantages, and shortcomings. Finally, seen from these three perspectives, this survey provides an outlook for future research in this direction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s13389-021-00255-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100110511&doi=10.1007%2fs13389-021-00255-w&partnerID=40&md5=b9589e26a7288eed5ca294b81b7358fc,Article

57,Scopus,Wang et al. (2022),2022,Silicon nitride stress-optic microresonator modulator for optical control applications,Optics Express,"Modulation-based control and locking of lasers, filters and other photonic components is a ubiquitous function across many applications that span the visible to infrared (IR), including atomic, molecular and optical (AMO), quantum sciences, fiber communications, metrology, and microwave photonics. Today, modulators used to realize these control functions consist of high-power bulk-optic components for tuning, sideband modulation, and phase and frequency shifting, while providing low optical insertion loss and operation from DC to 10s of MHz. In order to reduce the size, weight and cost of these applications and improve their scalability and reliability, modulation control functions need to be implemented in a low loss, wafer-scale CMOS-compatible photonic integration platform. The silicon nitride integration platform has been successful at realizing extremely low waveguide losses across the visible to infrared and components including high performance lasers, filters, resonators, stabilization cavities, and optical frequency combs. Yet, progress towards implementing low loss, low power modulators in the silicon nitride platform, while maintaining wafer-scale process compatibility has been limited. Here we report a significant advance in integration of a piezo-electric (PZT, lead zirconate titanate) actuated micro-ring modulation in a fully-planar, wafer-scale silicon nitride platform, that maintains low optical loss (0.03 dB/cm in a 625 µm resonator) at 1550 nm, with an order of magnitude increase in bandwidth (DC - 15 MHz 3-dB and DC - 25 MHz 6-dB) and order of magnitude lower power consumption of 20 nW improvement over prior PZT modulators. The modulator provides a &gt;14 dB extinction ratio (ER) and 7.1 million quality-factor (Q) over the entire 4 GHz tuning range, a tuning efficiency of 162 MHz/V, and delivers the linearity required for control applications with 65.1 dB·Hz2/3 and 73.8 dB·Hz2/3 third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) at 1 MHz and 10 MHz respectively. We demonstrate two control applications, laser stabilization in a Pound-Drever Hall (PDH) lock loop, reducing laser frequency noise by 40 dB, and as a laser carrier tracking filter. This PZT modulator design can be extended to the visible in the ultra-low loss silicon nitride platform with minor waveguide design changes. This integration of PZT modulation in the ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguide platform enables modulator control functions in a wide range of visible to IR applications such as atomic and molecular transition locking for cooling, trapping and probing, controllable optical frequency combs, low-power external cavity tunable lasers, quantum computers, sensors and communications, atomic clocks, and tunable ultra-low linewidth lasers and ultra-low phase noise microwave synthesizers. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,10.1364/OE.467721,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136203100&doi=10.1364%2fOE.467721&partnerID=40&md5=1b0fbb4b2acd8a51926ac6e626e7c03d,Article

(2022),2022,Efficient generation of entangled multiphoton graph states from a single atom,Nature,"The central technological appeal of quantum science resides in exploiting quantum effects, such as entanglement, for a variety of applications, including computing, communication and sensing1. The overarching challenge in these fields is to address, control and protect systems of many qubits against decoherence2. Against this backdrop, optical photons, naturally robust and easy to manipulate, represent ideal qubit carriers. However, the most successful technique so far for creating photonic entanglement3 is inherently probabilistic and, therefore, subject to severe scalability limitations. Here we report the implementation of a deterministic protocol4–6 for the creation of photonic entanglement with a single memory atom in a cavity7. We interleave controlled single-photon emissions with tailored atomic qubit rotations to efficiently grow Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states8 of up to 14 photons and linear cluster states9 of up to 12 photons with a fidelity lower bounded by 76(6)% and 56(4)%, respectively. Thanks to a source-to-detection efficiency of 43.18(7)% per photon, we measure these large states about once every minute, which is orders of magnitude faster than in any previous experiment3,10–13. In the future, this rate could be increased even further, the scheme could be extended to two atoms in a cavity14,15 or several sources could be quantum mechanically coupled16, to generate higher-dimensional cluster states17.

Selective acid-catalysed depolymerisation of the lignin β-O-4 linking motif with stabilization of the formed aldehydes by diols is a promising approach to obtain phenolic monomers in high yields. However, the lignin β-O-4 linking motif exists in both the erythro and threo isomeric forms, and very little information is available on the influence of stereochemistry on the efficiency of the lignin diol-stabilised acidolysis. This is especially true for the set of intermediates in which the presence of stereochemistry persists. In this study, the stereoisomer ratios of two key intermediates, namely the diol (here ethylene glycol) adducts and C2-vinyl ethers, are monitored carefully in ytterbium(iii) trifluoromethanesulfonate [Yb(OTf)3]-catalysed conversion of an erythro β-O-4 model compound. The reactions showed the preferential formation and consumption of the ethylene glycol adduct in the erythro configuration, and the favored formation of trans C2-vinyl ether. Multiscale computational methods (including classical reactive molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations) were applied to elucidate the catalytic origins of the observed stereo-preferences and suggested that a proto-trans intermediate complex is stabilised by a hydrogen bond network connecting the carbocation, ethylene glycol, and the anionic [OTf]− species.

Unidirectional beam tracking and live reference-frame alignment systems at the receiver side enable a stable operation over tens of seconds when aiming the portable transmitter to the receiver input by hand from a distance of about half a meter. The user-friendliness of our system was confirmed by successful key exchanges performed by different untrained users with an average link efficiency of about 20% relative to the case of the transmitter being stationarily mounted and aligned. In these tests we achieve an average quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of 2.4% and asymptotic secret key rates ranging from 4.0kbps to 15.3kbps.

Understanding of plant responses to different UV radiation is sparse, especially from a systems biology perspective and particularly for conifers. Here, we evaluated the physiological and transcriptomic responses to the short-term application of high-irradiance UV-B and UV-C waves on Pinus tabuliformis Carr., a major conifer in Northern China. By undertaking time-ordered gene coexpression network analyses and network comparisons incorporating physiological traits and gene expression variation, we uncovered communalities but also differences in P. tabuliformis responses to UV-B and UV-C. Both types of spectral bands caused a significant inhibition of photosynthesis, and conversely, the improvement of antioxidant capacity, flavonoid production and signaling pathways related to stress resistance, indicating a clear switch from predominantly primary metabolism to enhanced defensive metabolism in pine. We isolated distinct subnetworks for photoreceptor-mediated signal transduction, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) regulation and flavonoid biosynthesis in response to UV-B and UV-C radiation. From these subnetworks, we further identified phototropins as potentially important elements in both UV-B and UV-C signaling and, for the first time, suggesting peptide hormones to be involved in promoting flavonoid biosynthesis against UV-B, while these hormones seem not to be implicated in the defense against UV-C exposure. The present study employed an effective strategy for disentangling the complex physiological and genetic regulatory mechanisms in a nonmodel plant species, and thus, provides a suitable reference for future functional evaluations and artificial UV-light mediated growing strategies in plant production. © 2022 The Author(s).

We first construct (2 n+ 1 ) -qubit entangled channels via Hadamard gates and controlled-NOT gates and then propose two new (n+ 2 ) -party schemes for the quantum broadcast and multi-cast communications to guarantee that the sender can broadcast arbitrary complex coefficient single-qubit states to the n receivers, respectively, and synchronously under the control of the supervisor. In the first scheme, the quantum information transmitted synchronously comes from the same arbitrary complex coefficient single-qubit state, while the second scheme guarantees that the information is different among the n receivers to satisfy the requirement of the quantum multi-cast communications. Each scheme introduces auxiliary qubits and employs the feedforward strategy so that each receiver can successfully obtain the desired quantum state with success probability 100%.

Here, we demonstrate bright telecom-wavelength single-photon sources based on In(Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) deterministically coupled to hybrid circular Bragg resonators (h-CBRs) by using a wide-field fluorescence imaging technique. The QD emissions are redshifted toward the telecom O-band by using an ultra-low InAs growth rate and an InGaAs strain reducing layer. Single-photon emissions under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed operations are demonstrated, showing high brightness with count rates of 1.14 MHz and 0.34 MHz under saturation powers and single-photon purities of g(2)(0) = 0.11 ± 0.02 (CW) and g(2)(0) = 0.087 ± 0.003 (pulsed) at low excitation powers. A Purcell factor of 4.2 with a collection efficiency of 11.2% ± 1% at the first lens is extracted, suggesting efficient coupling between the QD and h-CBR.

Many works have examined the behavior of the fall of stock markets and have built models to predict them. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the available research, and the literature calls for more investigation on the topic, as currently the accuracy of the models remains low and they have only been extended for the largest economies. This study provides a comparison of quantum forecast methods and stock market declines and, therefore, a new prediction model of stock market crashes via real-time recession probabilities with the power to accurately estimate future global stock market downturn scenarios is achieved. A 104-country sample has been used, allowing the sample compositions to take into account the regional diversity of the alert warning indicators. To obtain a robust model, several alternative techniques have been employed on the sample under study, being Quantum Boltzmann Machines, which have obtained very good prediction results due to their ability to remember features and develop long-term dependencies from time series and sequential data.

Scaling the complexity requires architectures containing multiple photon sources, photon counters and a large number of indistinguishable single photons. Semiconductor quantum dots are bright and fast sources of coherent single photons5–9. For applications, a roadblock is the poor quantum coherence on interfering single photons created by independent quantum dots10,11. Here we demonstrate two-photon interference with near-unity visibility (93.0 ± 0.8)% using photons from two completely separate GaAs quantum dots. The experiment retains all the emission into the zero phonon line—only the weak phonon sideband is rejected; temporal post-selection is not employed. By exploiting quantum interference, we demonstrate a photonic controlled-not circuit and an entanglement with fidelity of (85.0 ± 1.0)% between photons of different origins. The two-photon interference visibility is high enough that the entanglement fidelity is well above the classical threshold. The high mutual coherence of the photons stems from high-quality materials, diode structure and relatively large quantum dot size.

(2022),2022,An object-based image analysis in QGIS for image classification and assessment of coastal spatial planning,Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science,"In practice, urban and regional planners often use a pixel-based method for image classification. Unfortunately, it produces lower accuracy than an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method, especially for the high-resolution images. To assess spatial planning, scholars rarely used the OBIA method in open-source software. This paper aims to develop a method for classifying land cover and assessing coastal spatial planning. We used Sentinel-2A in 2015 and 2020 as the basic data. For image classification, we used the OBIA method in Quantum GIS (QGIS) 3.10.6 and Orfeo ToolBox 7.1.0. Furthermore, we used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Cellular Automata (CA) algorithms in QGIS 2.18.20 for projecting future land cover change, and then used the projected land cover map to assess the spatial planning in 2031. The results show that the OBIA method is useful for image classification, achieving 94.50 and 90.98 percent of the overall accuracy for the imageries in 2015 and 2020, respectively. Our coastal spatial planning assessment shows that the plan has not considered adequately the rapid land cover change of the region, especially the increase in waterbodies. We advocate that the local government should consider this issue when evaluating the spatial planning. The methodology using an open-source software such as QGIS in a developing country context also provides a promising exemplar that other local governments can use for assessing their spatial planning. © 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science",,10.1016/j.ejrs.2022.03.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126063087&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejrs.2022.03.002&partnerID=40&md5=8edb36e49ebdcd239b7ca6713acc7f7b,Article

The proper and secure functioning of the devices can be certified by a statistical test using a Bell inequality10–12. This test originates from the foundations of quantum physics and also ensures robustness against implementation loopholes13, thereby leaving only the integrity of the users’ locations to be guaranteed by other means. The realization of DIQKD, however, is extremely challenging—mainly because it is difficult to establish high-quality entangled states between two remote locations with high detection efficiency. Here we present an experimental system that enables for DIQKD between two distant users. The experiment is based on the generation and analysis of event-ready entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms located in buildings 400 metre apart14. By achieving an entanglement fidelity of ℱ≥0.892(23) and implementing a DIQKD protocol with random key basis15, we observe a significant violation of a Bell inequality of S = 2.578(75)—above the classical limit of 2—and a quantum bit error rate of only 0.078(9). For the protocol, this results in a secret key rate of 0.07 bits per entanglement generation event in the asymptotic limit, and thus demonstrates the system’s capability to generate secret keys.

Strain-localized excitons in TMDC monolayers have so far mainly been observed under cryogenic conditions because of their subwavelength emission area, low quantum yield, and thermal-fluctuation-induced delocalization. Herein, we demonstrate both generation and detection of strain-localized excitons in WS2monolayer through a simple plasmonic structure design, where WS2monolayer covers individual Au nanodisks or nanorods. Enhanced emission from the strain-localized excitons of the deformed WS2monolayer near the plasmonic hotspots is observed at room temperature with a photoluminescence energy redshift up to 200 meV. The emission intensity and peak energy of the strain-localized excitons can be adjusted by the nanodisk size.

Recently, it's been shown that large, randomly initialized neural networks contain subnetworks that perform as well as fully trained models. This insight offers a promising avenue for training future neural networks by simply pruning weights from large, random models.

Central to these networks is the ability to distribute entanglement between distant nodes using photonic channels. Initially developed for quantum teleportation3,4 and loophole-free tests of Bell’s inequality5,6, recently, entanglement distribution has also been achieved over telecom fibres and analysed retrospectively7,8. Yet, to fully use entanglement over long-distance quantum network links it is mandatory to know it is available at the nodes before the entangled state decays. Here we demonstrate heralded entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms generated over fibre links with a length up to 33 km. For this, we generate atom–photon entanglement in two nodes located in buildings 400 m line-of-sight apart and to overcome high-attenuation losses in the fibres convert the photons to telecom wavelength using polarization-preserving quantum frequency conversion9. The long fibres guide the photons to a Bell-state measurement setup in which a successful photonic projection measurement heralds the entanglement of the atoms10. Our results show the feasibility of entanglement distribution over telecom fibre links useful, for example, for device-independent quantum key distribution11–13 and quantum repeater protocols.

81,Scopus,Chen et al. (2022),2022,Accelerating spiking neural networks using quantum algorithm with high success probability and high calculation accuracy,Neurocomputing,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a kind of neuromorphic computing which meticulously imitates the operations of biological nervous systems. Thus, the SNN is seen as a promising approach to further improve the level of intelligence that the legacy artificial neural networks achieved. In a spiking neuron of an SNN, it is a key step with the highest computing complexity to find out the moment when the output stimuli occur. Classic computer (i.e., electrical computer) based acceleration cannot reduce the computational complexity of the operations in the spiking neurons. As a result, the SNN suffers from scaling and deeper emulation problems. Considering these, in this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm to reduce the complexity of the key steps in the SNN and use this algorithm to build a quantum spiking neuron network (QSNN). More specifically, first, we give mathematical proof that the problem of finding the output stimuli is approximately equal to the problem of calculating the unsigned vector inner products, which can transfer to a quantum operation. Second, we design a scalable quantum circuit of QSNN for data of any dimension and evaluate its basic success probability and calculation accuracy. Third, to improve the QSNN performance, we propose a method to improve the minimum success probability to 99.8%, by repeatedly performing the quantum circuit only 11 times. Fourth, we prove that the computational complexity of the QSNN is a log-polynomial relationship with the data dimension, which is much lower than that of the linear complexity of the classic SNN. Finally, we apply the QSNN to solve classification tasks on two real-world datasets, i.e., MNIST and fashion MNIST which both have two noise levels (i.e., no noise and 50% of the noise). The experiment results show that in addition to the acceleration, QSNN and SNN have equal classification accuracy, which suggests the feasibility and robustness of the QSNN. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.neucom.2022.02.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124765269&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2022.02.004&partnerID=40&md5=0f63b9487c0207bc72711a5c14aaddba,Article
82,Scopus,Quinteiro et al. (2022),2022,Interplay between optical vortices and condensed matter,Reviews of Modern Physics,"Interest in the multiple facets of optical vortices has flourished in the last three decades. This review examines the basic research and applications of the interplay between optical vortices and condensed-matter systems. This subfield of optical-vortex physics has rapidly developed in recent years thanks to a vigorous synergy between theory and experiment. After presenting self-contained and focused introductions to optical vortices and condensed-matter optics, theory and current progress in the research on the interaction of condensed-matter systems and optical vortices are examined. When one considers the interaction of optical vortices with condensed-matter systems, many aspects of the standard theory of the interaction of matter with plane-wave light need to be reformulated. In bulk, light-matter Hamiltonian matrix elements have to be recalculated and novel selection rules are obtained, reflecting the conservation of total angular momentum. Orbital angular momentum is transferred from the light beam to the photoexcited electrons, thereby generating macroscopic currents. Semiconductor nanostructures add the complexity of their own spatial inhomogeneity, which is handled adequately by the envelope-function approximation. Here again modified matrix elements for light-matter interactions dictate the allowed and forbidden optical transitions, which are distinct from those obtained in traditional optical excitation with smooth fields. Quantum rings play a central role due to their specially adapted geometry to the cylindrical nature of the optical-vortex beams. When the electron-electron interaction is taken into account, the rich physics of excitons and exciton polaritons comes into play and is modified by the finite orbital angular momentum of the structured light. Furthermore, the new features brought about by optical vortices in plasmonics and in the optical excitation of two-dimensional materials are reviewed. For all these systems theory and recent experiments are discussed. Finally, an overview of current and prospective applications of the interaction of optical vortices with condensed-matter systems in the fields of quantum technologies, communications, sensing, etc., is presented.

In this context, optomechanical strong coupling can enable efficient, high-bandwidth, and deterministic transfer of quantum states. While optomechanical strong coupling has been realized at optical frequencies, it has proven difficult to identify a robust optomechanical system that features the low loss and high coupling rates required for more sophisticated control of mechanical motion. In this paper, we demonstrate strong coupling in a Brillouin-based bulk cavity optomechanical system in both the single-mode and the multimode strong-coupling regime, which leads to a useful device both for applications in quantum information and for investigating decoherence phenomena in bulk acoustic wave resonators. Using nontrivial mode hybridizations in the strong-coupling regime, we create hybridized photonic-phononic modes with lifetimes that are significantly longer than those of the uncoupled system. This surprising lifetime enhancement, which results from the interference of decay channels, showcases the use of multimode strong coupling as a general strategy to control extrinsic decoherence mechanisms. Moreover, phonons supported by such bulk-acoustic-wave resonators have a collection of properties, including high frequencies, long coherence times, and robustness against thermal decoherence, that make this optomechanical system particularly enticing for applications such as quantum transduction and memories. Hence, this system provides access to phenomena in a previously unexplored regime of optomechanical interactions and could serve as an important building block for future quantum devices. © 2022 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.18.024054,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136143018&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevApplied.18.024054&partnerID=40&md5=5b6916fbc9cba51a62c2117aeb1593c6,Article

But would such a theory, which effectively describes the behavior of microscopic physical systems and its predicted phenomena such as quantum entanglement, still be applicable on large length scales? From a practical perspective, how can quantum key distribution (where the security of establishing secret keys between distant parties is ensured by the laws of quantum mechanics) be made technologically useful on a global scale? Owing to photon loss in optical fibers and terrestrial free space, the achievable distance using direct transmission of single photons has been limited to a few hundred kilometers. A promising route to testing quantum physics over long distances and in the relativistic regimes, and thus realizing flexible global-scale quantum networks, is via the use of satellites and space-based technologies, where a significant advantage is that the photon loss and turbulence predominantly occurs in the lower ∼10 km of the atmosphere, and most of the photons' transmission path in space is virtually in vacuum, with almost zero absorption and decoherence.

We investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics for the time-independent case. In the adiabatically driven case, we show how measurement-based thermodynamic quantities can be attributed geometric characteristics. We also provide the appropriate definition for heat transfer and dissipation owing to continuous measurement in the presence and absence of adiabatic driving. We illustrate the aforementioned ideas and study the phenomenon of refrigeration in two different paradigmatic examples: a coupled quantum dot and a coupled qubit system, both undergoing continuous measurement and slow driving. In the time-independent case, we show that quantum coherence can improve the cooling power of measurement-based quantum refrigerators. Exclusively for the case of coupled qubits, we consider linear as well as nonlinear system-bath couplings. We observe that nonlinear coupling produces cooling effects in certain regimes where otherwise heating is expected. In the adiabatically driven case, we observe that quantum measurement can provide significant boost to the power of adiabatic quantum refrigerators. We also observe that the obtained boost can be larger than the sum of power due to individual effects. The measurement-based refrigerators can have similar or better coefficient of performance in the driven case compared to the static one in the regime where heat extraction is maximum.

The unique attributes of quantum materials can help address these needs by enabling new energy-efficient device concepts that implement neuromorphic ideas at the hardware level. In particular, strong correlations give rise to highly non-linear responses, such as conductive phase transitions that can be harnessed for short- and long-term plasticity. Similarly, magnetization dynamics are strongly non-linear and can be utilized for data classification.

We used the significant improvement in the accuracy of protein structure prediction recently implemented in AlphaFold that incorporates novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints of protein structures. The wild-type (WT) sequence and the mutated sequence, missing the Phe233, were reconstructed. The predicted local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) for the PURAwt and the PURA–Phe233del showed that the occurrence of the Phe233del affects between 220–320 amino acids. The distortion in the PURA structural conformation in the ~5 Å surrounding area after the p.Phe233del produces a conspicuous disruption of the repeat III, where the DNA and RNA helix unwinding capability occurs. PURA Protein–DNA docking corroborated these results in an in silico analysis that showed a loss of the contact of the PURA– Phe233del III repeat domain model with the DNA. Together, (i) the energetic and stereochemical, (ii) the hydropathic indexes and polarity surfaces, and (iii) the hybrid Quantum Mechanics–Molecular Mechanics (QM–MM) analyses of the PURA molecular models demarcate, at the atomic resolution, the specific surrounding region affected by these mutations and pave the way for future cell-based functional analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo mutation underpinning a PURA syndrome in a Latin American patient and highlights the importance of predicting the molecular effects in protein structure using artificial intelligence algorithms and molecular and atomic resolution stereochemical analyses. © 2022 by the authors.

In practice, TF-QKD needs to optimize all parameters when limited data sets are considered. The traditional exhaustive traversal or local search algorithm can’t meet the time and resource requirements of the real-time communication system. Combined with machine learning, parameter optimization prediction of QKD has become the mainstream of parameter optimization. Random forest (RF) is a classical algorithm of the bagging class in integrated learning, and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is an important algorithm in the neural network. This paper uses the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) of boosting class to predict the optimization parameters of TF-QKD and compares it with RF and BPNN. The results show that XGBoost can efficiently and accurately predict optimization parameters, and its performance is slightly better than RF and BPNN in parameter prediction, which can provide a reference for future real-time QKD networks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11128-022-03579-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133226294&doi=10.1007%2fs11128-022-03579-6&partnerID=40&md5=84962368bb235f55d5c593f32c9cafaa,Article

The mCSL is used to restrict the current channel in the 300 μm mesa of the micro-LED. Simulation results show that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the mCSL-confined micro-LED is lower at low current densities, while it is higher at high current densities, compared with conventional micro-LED without mCSL. The current density distribution and the recombination rate are analyzed to prove the better restriction of the current channel at higher current density, resulting in enhanced efficiency at higher current density. With the decrease of the size of the mCSL, the efficiency of the mCSL-confined micro-LED decreases at low current densities, but increases at high current densities.

However, the staggering computational complexity of these methods is such that for state-of-the-art performance, classical hardware requirements represent a significant bottleneck to further progress. Here we take the first steps to understanding whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) could meet the demand for more powerful architectures and test its effectiveness in proof-of-principle hybrid experiments.

This is the second of a two-part tutorial that surveys key elements of Quantum Bridge Analytics and its applications. Part I focused on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model which is presently the most widely applied optimization model in the quantum computing area, and which unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Part II (the present paper) introduces the domain of QUBO-Plus models that enables a larger range of problems to be handled effectively. After illustrating the scope of these QUBO-Plus models with examples, we give special attention to an important instance of these models called the Asset Exchange Problem (AEP). Solutions to the AEP enable market players to identify exchanges of assets that benefit all participants. Such exchanges are generated by a combination of two optimization technologies for this class of QUBO-Plus models, one grounded in network optimization and one based on a new metaheuristic optimization approach called combinatorial chaining. This combination opens the door to expanding the links to quantum computing applications established by QUBO models through the Quantum Bridge Analytics perspective. We show how the modeling and solution capability for the AEP instance of QUBO-Plus models provides a framework for solving a broad range of problems arising in financial, industrial, scientific, and social settings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s10479-022-04695-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129257955&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04695-3&partnerID=40&md5=4f90f23eb41c7ec04af412fdd32f0cba,Article

Then, we propose an on-demand quantum secured future fronthaul architecture and a channel allocation algorithm over hybrid core fibers, and the proposed coupled theoretical model is used to calculate the noises in architecture. For fronthaul optical signals, wavelength modes and the number of transceiver modules in the distributed unit (DU) can be dynamically adjusted according to requirements, and the function of load aggregation is adopted. For quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum signals are transmitted in a dedicated core, and wavelength-time multiplexing is adopted to increase the number of quantum secured base station (BSs) while improving wavelength utilization. Finally, simulation results show that proposed channel allocation algorithm can suppress noise about 60% compared to First-Fit. The architecture can save up to 83.3% modules in 7-core feeder fiber, and it is feasible to support 128 BSs. The experimental and simulation results show that the proposed coupled theoretical model matches well with the experimental results, and the quantum bit error rates in experiment are both lower than 2.5%. The results show that the architecture has the advantages of allocating time-space-frequency resources on-demand, saving power consumption, and expanding the number of users.

95,Scopus,Adib et al. (2022),2022,Colorless Coherent TDM-PON Based on a Frequency-Comb Laser,Journal of Lightwave Technology,"Coherent reception becomes an interesting option when data rates in time-division-multiplexed (TDM) passive optical networks (PONs) grow beyond 50 Gbit/s. Controlling the wavelength, i.e., the optical frequency, and the phase of the laser acting as local oscillator (LO) is one of the main technical challenges in the design of coherent TDM PONs. In the optical network units (ONUs), low-cost lasers are required, which come at the expense of wavelength variations and drifts over multiple nanometers due to fabrication imperfections, and temperature variations. This contradicts the requirement of wavelength-stable LOs in coherent receivers. The use of a wavelength locker circuit and a temperature controller is considered as too complex for applications in access networks. In this work, we propose a novel colorless coherent architecture with high resilience to ONU laser wavelength drifts of up to ± 4 nm (±0.5 THz) for future 100 Gbit/s PON. It allows the use of distributed feedback lasers at the ONU side. This is rendered possible by generating a frequency comb with carefully chosen free spectral range in a quantum-dash mode-locked laser diode at the optical line terminal. In upstream operation, the frequency comb serves as an LO, whereas the same information is modulated onto all comb lines for the case of downstream. As a result, the ONU laser can drift over the entire comb bandwidth without substantial performance penalty. We experimentally demonstrate downstream and upstream operation with an aggregated raw data rate of 96 Gbit/s, respectively. We further introduce advanced digital signal processing (DSP) methods including a coarse frequency offset compensation (CFOC) and a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) equalizer to improve the performance of our concept. We show that the receiver sensitivity can be increased by 3 dB for a high-bandwidth receiver when using a 6 × 2 MIMO equalizer scheme. A 4 × 2 MIMO equalizer scheme enables colorless reception even with a limited-bandwidth receiver. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/JLT.2022.3164168,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127477404&doi=10.1109%2fJLT.2022.3164168&partnerID=40&md5=61bf3ff12e0e54e7067a01575edba4d6,Article

This article aims to present a provably secure post-quantum authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol from supersingular isogenies under the extended Canetti–Krawczyk (eCK) security model, and provide an alternative for protecting communications over open channels from being attacked in the near future post-quantum era. Thus, the expected post-quantum AKE protocol from supersingular isogenies is presented in this article using the well-known SIDH and SIKE as its building blocks. The new post-quantum AKE protocol is formally proved secure under the strong eCK security model, which actually can also be formally proved secure in the CK + security model. In addition, the relatively time-consuming encapsulation algorithm can be performed in advance in the new AKE protocol, so in practice, the new AKE protocol may gain efficiency advantage over some existing AKE protocols from supersingular isogenies. So, considering the overall security and computation efficiency, it can be said that the presented post-quantum AKE protocol may be a good choice in the upcoming post-quantum era. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11227-022-04378-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126116388&doi=10.1007%2fs11227-022-04378-7&partnerID=40&md5=7e63ecd90c41f12ff36a16a3a1dc257a,Article

Recently, III-nitride heterostructures (e.g., AlGaN/GaN) based intersubband transition (ISBT) has garnered considerable research interest for infrared (IR), terahertz (THz), and ultrafast optoelectronics (e.g., photodetectors and quantum cascade lasers) due to its large conduction band offset, large optical phonon energy, and promising room-temperature operation. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the recent progress and challenges of III-nitrides based ISBT from the perspectives of materials, structures, devices, and applications, with a focus on nonpolar and semipolar III-nitrides. Various device structures have been demonstrated for III-nitrides based ISBT, including quantum wells, dots, and wires, among which AlGaN/GaN quantum wells are the most widely used. The effects of device parameters, crystal orientations, and doping on the ISBT properties of AlGaN/GaN quantum wells are discussed. Although the room-temperature operation is still elusive, theoretical and experimental studies show that nonpolar and semipolar III-nitrides based ISBT exhibits tunable ISBT wavelength from far-IR to THz spectral range with higher efficiency compared with polar c-plane ISBT.

The feasibility of the modified detector model against the fast-fading channel is proved. The results of the symmetry operations are considered when presenting detailed security analysis. Some remarkable features of the uniform fast-fading channel were found from the simulation results. The performances of the conventional model and the modified model are similar but the modified model has the advantage of achieving one-time calibration. © 2022 by the authors.

(2022),2022,High-Precision Voltage Measurement for Optical Quantum Computation,Energies,"This paper presents a theoretical study into the use of optical systems for quantum computation. The study results pertain to quantum sampling and quantum communication and provide a basis for further research and the development of a physical implementation. We propose an optical superstructure that can implement specific computation processes and algorithms. The superstructure is composed of nonlinear optical units, such as beta barium borate crystals. The units are positioned in series, powered by a pulse laser pump, and culminate in a beam splitter that generates the output state of a number of entangled photon pairs. Computation is achieved by entanglement propagation via beam splitters and adjustable phase shifters, which set related parameters. Demonstrating a two-component case, we show how a series of cosine-based components can be implemented. The obtained results open a broad front for future research. Future work should investigate the construction of a quantum optimizer using quantum sampling methods and also investigate high-precision temporal voltage measurement, which is a key procedure for the construction of high-fidelity devices. © 2022 by the authors.

106,Scopus,Paul et al. (2022),2022,Delineation of Pathogenomic Insights of Breast Cancer in Young Women,Cells,"The prognosis of breast cancer (BC) in young women (BCYW) aged ≤ 40 years tends to be poorer than that in older patients due to aggressive phenotypes, late diagnosis, distinct biologic, and poorly understood genomic features of BCYW. Considering the estimated predisposition of only approximately 15% of the BC population to BC-promoting genes, the underlying reasons for an increased occurrence of BCYW, at large, cannot be completely explained based on general risk factors for BC. This underscores the need for the development of next-generation of tissue-and body fluid-based prognostic and predictive biomarkers for BCYW. Here, we identified the genes associated with BCYW with a particular focus on the age, intrinsic BC subtypes, matched normal or normal breast tissues, and BC laterality. In young women with BC, we observed dysregulation of age-associated cancer-relevant gene sets in both cancer and normal breast tissues, sub-sets of which substantially affected the overall survival (OS) or relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with BC and exhibited statically significant correlations with several gene modules associated with cellular processes such as the stroma, immune responses, mitotic progression, early response, and steroid responses. For example, high expression of COL1A2, COL5A2, COL5A1, NPY1R, and KIAA1644 mRNAs in the BC and normal breast tissues from young women correlated with a substantial reduction in the OS and RFS of BC patients with increased levels of these exemplified genes. Many of the genes upregulated in BCYW were overexpressed or underexpressed in normal breast tissues, which might provide clues regarding the potential involvement of such genes in the development of BC later in life. Many of BCYW-associated gene products were also found in the extracellular microvesicles/exosomes secreted from breast and other cancer cell-types as well as in body fluids such as urine, saliva, breast milk, and plasma, raising the possibility of using such approaches in the development of non-invasive, predictive and prognostic biomarkers. In conclusion, the findings of this study delineated the pathogenomics of BCYW, providing clues for future exploration of the potential predictive and prognostic importance of candidate BCYW molecules and research strategies as well as a rationale to undertake a prospective clinical study to examine some of testable hypotheses presented here. In addition, the results presented here provide a framework to bring out the importance of geographical disparities, to overcome the current bottlenecks in BCYW, and to make the next quantum leap for sporadic BCYW research and treatment. © 2022 by the authors.

As long as the channel noise is less than the noise tolerance of the protocol, Alice and Bob can withdraw a secure key.

This study examined the effects of cooling engineering on regulating the excited states to realize high-quality ZnSeTe core-shell QDs. The presence of ultrafast hot-carrier trapping and band-edge carrier trapping is responsible for the poor emission efficiency in ZnSeTe QDs. The above processes can be suppressed simultaneously by engineering the cooling process, and the underlying mechanisms are interrogated by combined electronic and spectroscopic characterization. The engineered ZnSeTe QDs exhibited record-high efficiency (>90%) and stability that were comparable to those of the canonical CdSe QDs.

This threat has sparked increased interest in the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and standardization bodies like NIST, IETF, and ETSI are in the process of standardizing PQC schemes as a new generation of cryptography. This raises the question of how to ensure a fast, reliable, and secure transition to upcoming PQC standards in today's highly interconnected world. In this work, we propose and investigate a migration strategy towards post-quantum (PQ) authentication for the network protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS). Our strategy is based on the concept of ""mixed certificate chains""that use different signature algorithms within the same certificate chain. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our migration strategy, we combine the well-studied and trusted hash-based signature schemes SPHINCS+ and XMSS with elliptic curve cryptography first and subsequently with lattice-based PQC signature schemes (CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon). Furthermore, we combine authentication based on mixed certificate chains with the lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) CRYSTALS-Kyber as representative for PQC KEMs to evaluate a fully post-quantum and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3 handshake. Our results show that mixed certificate chains containing hash-based signature schemes only at the root certificate authority level lead to feasible connection establishment times despite the increase in communication size. By analyzing code size and peak memory usage of our client and server programs we further demonstrate the suitability of our migration strategy even for embedded devices. © 2022 ACM.",,10.1145/3488932.3497755,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133160412&doi=10.1145%2f3488932.3497755&partnerID=40&md5=d9fc0b9259b9c577dcd36957c370565f,Conference Paper

Digital twin technology can be applied in 3D IoT smart factories, new smart city construction, smart medical care, digital energy, digital archives, warehousing and logistics visualization and other fields. Deep learning covers a wide range of applications and is extremely common. This paper discusses the application of the two in the risk prediction of coal and gas outburst strength. This paper firstly describes the method of predicting coal and gas outburst intensity. For example, the BP neural network algorithm applied to the prediction of coal and gas outburst intensity in deep learning, the air flow control system model of digital twin for coal mines, and the risk assessment algorithm of coal and gas outburst intensity in coal mines based on grey relational analysis, and various ways to predict risk.

Quantum teleportation allows for the reliable transfer of quantum information between distant nodes, even in the presence of highly lossy network connections3. Although many experimental demonstrations have been performed on different quantum network platforms4–10, moving beyond directly connected nodes has, so far, been hindered by the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint qubit readout and coherence times. Here we realize quantum teleportation between remote, non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network. The network uses three optically connected nodes based on solid-state spin qubits. The teleporter is prepared by establishing remote entanglement on the two links, followed by entanglement swapping on the middle node and storage in a memory qubit. We demonstrate that, once successful preparation of the teleporter is heralded, arbitrary qubit states can be teleported with fidelity above the classical bound, even with unit efficiency. These results are enabled by key innovations in the qubit readout procedure, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation and tailored heralding that reduces remote entanglement infidelities.

Following a bottom-up data-driven potential approach, we initially looked into the classical behavior of higher-order X−(H2O)N clusters. We have located several low-lying energies, such as global and local minima, structures for each cluster, with various water molecules (up to N = 8) surrounding the halide anion (X− = F−, Cl−, Br−, I−), employing an evolutionary programming method. It is found that the F−-water clusters exhibit different structural configurations than the heavier halides, however independently of the halide anion, all clusters show in general a selective growth with the anion preferring to be connected to the outer shell of the water molecule arrangements. In turn, path-integral molecular dynamics simulations are performed to incorporate explicitly nuclear quantum and thermal effects in describing the nature of halide ion microsolvation in such prototypical model systems. Our data reveal that at low finite temperatures, nuclear quantum effects affect certain structural properties, such as weakening hydrogen bonding between the halide anion and water molecules, with minor distortions in the water network beyond the first hydration shell, indicating local structure rearrangements. Such structural characteristics and the promising cluster size trends observed in the single-ion solvation energies motivated us to draw connections of small size cluster data to the limits of continuum bulk values, toward the investigation of the challenging computational modeling of bulk single ion hydration. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/d2cp01396g,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132221649&doi=10.1039%2fd2cp01396g&partnerID=40&md5=6ed62976457a66310e0d276e694a81f2,Article

The SUCI protects the new generation of cellular networks against tracking devices, so-called IMSI-catchers, which have undermined users' confidentiality ever since the inception of cellular networks. However, the potential advent of large-scale quantum computers in the near future threatens to compromise the confidentiality provided by the SUCI yet again. The security of the public-key cryptography that underpins the SUCI relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Using Shor's algorithm, a quantum adversary could break the SUCI's cryptography and once more gain the capability to track and identify users. Advancements in quantum computing are unpredictable, and a breakthrough might be only a decade away. Given the slow nature of standards and their implementation, it is thus necessary to already integrate now quantum-resistant cryptography into the current and also next-generation (6G) cellular networks. To contribute to this development, we propose a post-quantum secure scheme for the SUCI calculation, KEMSUCI. To this end, we first analyze the weak points in the current SUCI calculation scheme when considering quantum attacks. We then describe an alternative SUCI calculation scheme based on post-quantum secure key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). Our proposed scheme can use any of the KEMs submitted to the NIST call for standardization of post-quantum secure cryptography (PQC) schemes. For the usage in KEMSUCI, the KEM should provide efficient execution on a SIM card and induce little network communication overhead. We evaluate all of the NIST PQC finalists under these aspects and identify Kyber and Saber as the best fit. Instantiated with these KEMs, KEMSUCI can be integrated into 5G and 6G. Compared to the existing SUPI protection schemes, KEMSUCI exhibits faster execution speed and only little communication overhead. © 2022 ACM.",,10.1145/3507657.3528540,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130439503&doi=10.1145%2f3507657.3528540&partnerID=40&md5=1eace8f4ec3ab432c60346de6c58ecac,Conference Paper

Their local symmetries enforce the charge conservation observed in the laws of physics. Impressive experimental progress has demonstrated that they can be engineered in table-top experiments using synthetic quantum systems. However, the challenges posed by the scalability of such lattice gauge simulators are pressing, thereby making the exploration of different experimental setups desirable. Here, we realize a U(1) lattice gauge theory with five matter sites and four gauge links in classical electric circuits employing nonlinear elements connecting LC oscillators. This allows for probing previously inaccessible spectral and transport properties in a multisite system. We directly observe Gauss's law, known from electrodynamics, and the emergence of long-range interactions between massive particles in full agreement with theoretical predictions.

(2022),2022,"Miniaturized NIR Spectroscopy in Food Analysis and Quality Control: Promises, Challenges, and Perspectives",Foods,"The ongoing miniaturization of spectrometers creates a perfect synergy with the common advantages of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, which together provide particularly significant benefits in the field of food analysis. The combination of portability and direct onsite application with high throughput and a noninvasive way of analysis is a decisive advantage in the food industry, which features a diverse production and supply chain. A miniaturized NIR analytical framework is readily applicable to combat various food safety risks, where compromised quality may result from an accidental or intentional (i.e., food fraud) origin. In this review, the characteristics of miniaturized NIR sensors are discussed in comparison to benchtop laboratory spectrometers regarding their performance, applicability, and optimization of methodology. Miniaturized NIR spectrometers remarkably increase the flexibility of analysis; however, various factors affect the performance of these devices in different analytical scenarios. Currently, it is a focused research direction to perform systematic evaluation studies of the accuracy and reliability of various miniaturized spectrometers that are based on different technologies; e.g., Fourier transform (FT)-NIR, micro-optoelectro-mechanical system (MOEMS)-based Hadamard mask, or linear variable filter (LVF) coupled with an array detector, among others. Progressing technology has been accompanied by innovative data-analysis methods integrated into the package of a micro-NIR analytical framework to improve its accuracy, reliability, and applicability. Advanced calibration methods (e.g., artificial neural networks (ANN) and nonlinear regression) directly improve the performance of miniaturized instruments in challenging analyses, and balance the accuracy of these instruments toward laboratory spectrometers. The quantum-mechanical simulation of NIR spectra reveals the wavenumber regions where the best-correlated spectral information resides and unveils the interactions of the target analyte with the surrounding matrix, ultimately enhancing the information gathered from the NIR spectra. A datafusion framework offers a combination of spectral information from sensors that operate in different wavelength regions and enables parallelization of spectral pretreatments. This set of methods enables the intelligent design of future NIR analyses using miniaturized instruments, which is critically important for samples with a complex matrix typical of food raw material and shelf products. © 2022 by the authors.

(2022),2022,Efficient frame synchronization using a weak coherent state for continuous-variable quantum key distribution,Physical Review A,"Frame synchronization is a crucial step in quantum key distribution (QKD) and a prerequisite for secure key distillation. Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fast phase drift in the continuous-variable QKD system, efficient frame synchronization is highly demanded. In this paper, a frame-synchronization scheme based on weak coherent states is proposed. This scheme uses a train of coherent-state pulses encoded by a Zadoff-Chu sequence to achieve frame synchronization. The synchronization performance is analyzed under different transmission distances, transmit powers, frequency offsets, and phase drifts through Monte Carlo simulation. Its performance is also compared with other synchronization sequences, confirming its noise-tolerance capability. An optical experiment is conducted to verify the feasibility of the synchronization scheme under low SNR (as low as -20 dB), and the applicable SNR range can be further reduced by increasing the sequence length. Due to its efficiency and noise tolerance, this scheme can provide technical support for weak-coherent-state-based QKD and future quantum network construction. © 2022 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.105.052407,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130527485&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.105.052407&partnerID=40&md5=8de71011e0f7bc44473f73ab0732ff5a,Article

(2022),2022,Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm applied to neural architecture search,Applied Soft Computing,"The success of machine learning models over the last few years is mostly related to the significant progress of deep neural networks. These powerful and flexible models can even surpass human-level performance in tasks such as image recognition and strategy games. However, experts need to spend considerable time and resources to design the network structure. The demand for new architectures drives interest in automating this design process. Researchers have proposed new algorithms to address the neural architecture search (NAS) problem, including efforts to reduce the high computational cost of such methods. A common approach to improve efficiency is to reduce the search space with the help of expert knowledge, searching for cells rather than entire networks. Motivated by the faster convergence promoted by quantum-inspired evolutionary methods, the Q-NAS algorithm was proposed to address the NAS problem without relying on cell search. In this work, we consolidate Q-NAS, adding a new penalization feature, enhancing its retraining scheme, and also investigating more challenging search spaces than before. In CIFAR-10, we reached 93.85% of test accuracy in 67 GPU days, considering the addition of an early-stopping mechanism. We also applied Q-NAS to CIFAR-100, without modifying the parameters, and our best accuracy was 74.23%, which is comparable to ResNet164. The enhancements and results presented in this work show that Q-NAS can automatically generate network architectures that outperform hand-designed models for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Also, compared to other NAS methods, Q-NAS results are promising regarding the balance between performance, runtime efficiency, and automation. We believe that our results enrich the discussion on this balance, considering alternatives to the cell search approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.asoc.2022.108674,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126619451&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2022.108674&partnerID=40&md5=c0fbf62383c4bcd0f7402c3d01206657,Article

(2022),2022,Direct Modulation and Free-Space Transmissions of up to 6 Gbps Multilevel Signals With a 4.65-μQuantum Cascade Laser at Room Temperature,Journal of Lightwave Technology,"A roadmap for future wireless communications is expected to exploit all transmission-suitable spectrum bands, from the microwave to the optical frequencies, to support orders of magnitude faster data transfer with much lower latency than the deployed solutions nowadays. The currently under-exploited mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum is an essential building block for such an envisioned all-spectra wireless communication paradigm. Free-space optical (FSO) communications in the mid-IR region have recently attracted great interest due to their intrinsic merits of low propagation loss and high tolerance of atmospheric perturbations. Future development of viable mid-IR FSO transceivers requires a semiconductor source to fulfill the high bandwidth, low energy consumption, and small footprint requirements. In this context, quantum cascade laser (QCL) appears as a promisingtechnological choice. In this work, we present an experimental demonstration of a mid-IR FSO link enabled by a 4.65-μm directly modulated (DM) QCL operating at room temperature. We achieve a transmission data rate of up to 6 Gbps over a 0.5-m link distance. This achievement is enabled by system-level characterization and optimization of transmitter and receiver power level and frequency response and assisted with advanced modulation and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. This work pushes the QCL-based FSO technology one step closer to practical terrestrial applications, such as the fixed wireless access and the wireless mobile backhaul.

(2022),2022,Prediction for Origin-Destination Distribution of Dockless Shared Bicycles: A Case Study in Nanjing City,Frontiers in Public Health,"Shared bicycles are currently widely welcomed by the public due to their flexibility and convenience; they also help reduce chemical emissions and improve public health by encouraging people to engage in physical activities. However, during their development process, the imbalance between the supply and demand of shared bicycles has restricted the public's willingness to use them. Thus, it is necessary to forecast the demand for shared bicycles in different urban regions. This article presents a prediction model called QPSO-LSTM for the origin and destination (OD) distribution of shared bicycles by combining long short-term memory (LSTM) and quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO). LSTM is a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that solves the long-term dependence problem existing in the general RNN, and is suitable for processing and predicting important events with very long intervals and delays in time series. QPSO is an important swarm intelligence algorithm that solves the optimization problem by simulating the process of birds searching for food. In the QPSO-LSTM model, LSTM is applied to predict the OD numbers. QPSO is used to optimize the LSTM for a problem involving a large number of hyperparameters, and the optimal combination of hyperparameters is quickly determined. Taking Nanjing as an example, the prediction model is applied to two typical areas, and the number of bicycles needed per hour in a future day is predicted. QPSO-LSTM can effectively learn the cycle regularity of the change in bicycle OD quantity. Finally, the QPSO-LSTM model is compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), back propagation (BP), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This shows that the QPSO-LSTM prediction result is more accurate.

However, the diversity of these therapeutics is often limited by the degradation mechanisms experienced both in the formulation process and on the shelf after production. Due to the size constraints of experimental approaches, molecular models are crucial for studying these degradation mechanisms. One such mechanism of interest is deamidation, also known as the transition from neutral residues to acidic residues. In this study, we mapped out the deamidation of Asn-X dipeptides into Asp-X dipeptides using density functional theory (DFT). Full network mapping enabled us to predict the selectivity of the deamidation reaction between three primary pathways, as well as one theoretical pathway, as a function of solvent dielectric (Fig. 1). To meet this goal, we studied a total of 115 dipeptide reactions per modeled dielectric (460 total reactions). Modeled at a neutral pH and using quantum chemical and statistical thermodynamic methods, we computed the following values: enthalpy of reaction (ΔHRXN), entropy (ΔSRXN), Gibbs free energy of reaction (ΔGRXN), activation energy (EA), and the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor (log(A)) for each dipeptide. Additionally, by using chemical reaction principles, we generated a database of computed rate coefficients for all possible N-terminus Asn-X deamidation reactions at a neutral pH, predicted the most likely deamidation reaction mechanism for each dipeptide reaction, and matched our results against quantitative and qualitative trends previously noted by experimental literature. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/d2re00110a,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129174176&doi=10.1039%2fd2re00110a&partnerID=40&md5=059a729943081f616ab3bff83cb5384c,Article

Spacetime, with its locality, cannot be fundamental, but must somehow be emergent from entangled coherent quantum variables and their behaviors. There are, then, two immediate consequences: (i). if we start with non-locality, we need not explain non-locality. We must instead explain an emergence of locality and spacetime. (ii). There can be no emergence of spacetime without matter. These propositions flatly contradict General Relativity, which is foundationally local, can be formulated without matter, and in which there is no “emergence” of spacetime. If these be true, then quantum gravity cannot be a minor alteration of General Relativity but must demand its deep reformulation. This will almost inevitably lead to: matter not only curves spacetime, but “creates” spacetime. We will see independent grounds for the assertion that matter both curves and creates spacetime that may invite a new union of quantum gravity and General Relativity. This quantum creation of spacetime consists of: (i) fully non-local entangled coherent quantum variables. (ii) The onset of locality via decoherence. (iii) A metric in Hilbert space among entangled quantum variables by the sub-additive von Neumann entropy between pairs of variables. (iv) Mapping from metric distances in Hilbert space to metric distances in classical spacetime by episodic actualization events. (v) Discrete spacetime is the relations among these discrete actualization events. (vi) “Now” is the shared moment of actualization of one among the entangled variables when the amplitudes of the remaining entangled variables change instantaneously. (vii) The discrete, successive, episodic, irreversible actualization events constitute a quantum arrow of time. (viii) The arrow of time history of these events is recorded in the very structure of the spacetime constructed. (ix) Actual Time is a succession of two or more actual events. The theory inevitably yields a UV cutoff of a new type. The cutoff is a phase transition between continuous spacetime before the transition and discontinuous spacetime beyond the phase transition. This quantum creation of spacetime modifies General Relativity and may account for Dark Energy, Dark Matter, and the possible elimination of the singularities of General Relativity. Relations to Causal Set Theory, faithful Lorentzian manifolds, and past and future light cones joined at “Actual Now” are discussed. Possible observational and experimental tests based on: (i). the existence of Sub-Planckian photons, (ii). knee and ankle discontinuities in the high-energy gamma ray spectrum, and (iii). possible experiments to detect a creation of spacetime in the Casimir system are discussed. A quantum actualization enhancement of repulsive Casimir effect would be anti-gravitational and of possible practical use.

It does not adopt auxiliary photons either and simply needs single photons in PSDF, whose preparation and measurement can be easily implemented with current technology. So, it is not only of great feasibility in practice, but also simple and efficient. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s10773-022-05098-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128235015&doi=10.1007%2fs10773-022-05098-7&partnerID=40&md5=b48192293ec562eb9e10dca8f6c8dff3,Article

Here an inhomogeneous acoustic grating model based on coupled wave and dielectric grating theories is established to analyze the SBS process in water. The acoustic grating modulation process was theoretically analyzed based on the proposed model. The results show that variations of the Stokes peak intensity, frequency shift, and linewidth of SBS in water depend on the cosinusoidal refractive index modulation and periodic modulation of the acoustic grating. To verify the theoretical simulation results, an experimental system was designed to measure the SBS process in seawater with different temperatures and salinities. Theoretical results show coincidence with experimental values in the variation trend, and the numerical difference is about 10 MHz per degree Celsius or one thousandth of salinity.

141,Scopus,Schöffel et al. (2022),2022,Secure IoT in the Era of Quantum Computers—Where Are the Bottlenecks?,Sensors,"Recent progress in quantum computers severely endangers the security of widely used public-key cryptosystems and of all communication that relies on it. Thus, the US NIST is currently exploring new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are robust against quantum computers. Security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices—even with pre-quantum public-key cryptography—since IoT devices have tight energy constraints, limited computational power and strict memory limitations. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth investigation of the application of potential post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms (DSAs) proposed in the related US NIST process to a state-of-the-art, TLS-based, low-power IoT infrastructure. We implemented these new KEMs and DSAs in such a representative infrastructure and measured their impact on energy consumption, latency and memory requirements during TLS handshakes on an IoT edge device. Based on our investigations, we gained the following new insights. First, we show that the main contributor to high TLS handshake latency is the higher bandwidth requirement of post-quantum primitives rather than the cryptographic computation itself. Second, we demonstrate that a smart combination of multiple DSAs yields the most energy-, latency-and memory-efficient public key infrastructures, in contrast to NIST’s goal to standardize only one algorithm. Third, we show that code-based, isogeny-based and lattice-based algorithms can be implemented on a low-power IoT edge device based on an off-the-shelf Cortex M4 microcontroller while maintaining viable battery runtimes. This is contrary to much research that claims dedicated hardware accelerators are mandatory. © 2022 by the authors.

The QD-LED device was fabricated using a quantum dot film (QDF), incorporating two kinds of quantum dots (QDs) synthesized to emit at 531 nm (green) and 624 nm (red). When the QDF is excited with blue wavelength at 465 nm, a white color output is obtained. Likewise, by using different color filters, all the automotive lighting functions (interior and exterior) can be achieved. In addition, an electronic control module, based on the state-of-the-art multichannel automotive lighting emitting diode (LED) drivers, was specifically designed to control each segment individually to enable the possibility of external digital communication with the vehicle surroundings. That is key to develop the autonomous vehicle by incorporating what is known as car-to-X communication, used to transmit information to other vehicles and road users through light. Furthermore, this work is remarkable due to the low power consumption of the QD-LED device designed, which implies a high electrical efficiency, something critical for the electrical vehicle development.

These phases have largely been studied in conservatively coupled systems, in which non-trivial topological invariants arise in the energy or frequency bands of a system. Here we show that, in dissipatively coupled systems, non-trivial topological invariants can emerge purely in a system’s dissipation. Using a highly scalable and easily reconfigurable time-multiplexed photonic resonator network, we experimentally demonstrate one- and two-dimensional lattices that host robust topological edge states with isolated dissipation rates, measure a dissipation spectrum that possesses a non-trivial topological invariant, and demonst rate topological protection of the network’s quality factor. The topologically non-trivial dissipation of our system exposes new opportunities to engineer dissipation in both classical and quantum systems. Moreover, our experimental platform’s straightforward scaling to higher dimensions and its ability to implement inhomogeneous, non-reciprocal and long range couplings may enable future work in the study of synthetic dimensions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,10.1038/s41567-021-01492-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124721925&doi=10.1038%2fs41567-021-01492-w&partnerID=40&md5=7293d6b194ba9bb97830c11b23b53fb9,Article

(2022),2022,General logic-operation-based lightweight group-key distribution schemes for Internet of Vehicles,Vehicular Communications,"It is predicted that the trend of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications will keep on growing due to its flexibility in infrastructure. The security of IoV can protect the peer-to-peer (P2P) data transmitted over Internet. Since most Internet devices are components with low battery power, low communication and computational power, the key distribution scheme for IoV needs to be lightweight. Most conventional communications in Internet of Vehicles are one-to-one types of communications which involve only two communication entities. Proposals for key distribution schemes are mostly developed to establish a pairwise key for a pair of users. For example, Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution scheme proposed in 1976 and the quantum key distribution scheme (QKD) invented in 1984 (also called the BB84 scheme), can only enable two users to share a secret key used in conventional one-to-one communications. Modern communications have been evolved into many-to-many types of communications which involve more than two users. Group-key distributions enable multiple users to share a group key. Recently, a lightweight group-key distribution scheme has been proposed which needs only logic operations. But this scheme can only provide confidentiality of the group key. In this paper, we extend that scheme to propose the first lightweight authenticated group-key distribution scheme which needs only logic operations. Our proposed schemes can be built on top of any type of authenticated pairwise-key distribution schemes. We first propose a basic three-party authenticated group-key distribution scheme. Then, general three multiple-party authenticated group-key distribution schemes based on the basic scheme are proposed. Since our proposed schemes need only logic operations, they are all lightweight and are suitable for P2P IoV communication applications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.vehcom.2022.100457,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123627159&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2022.100457&partnerID=40&md5=9ef12db766e4291ed0d93ad2327a2941,Article

Moreover, the interference of photons is indispensable for large-scale quantum information processing. With the development of quantum networks, interference of photons transmitted through long-distance fiber channels has been widely implemented. However, quantum interference of photons using free-space channels is still scarce, mainly due to atmospheric turbulence. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with photons transmitted by free-space channels. Two typical photon sources, i.e., correlated photon pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process and weak coherent states, are employed. A visibility of 0.744±0.013 is observed by interfering with two photons generated in the SPDC process, exceeding the classical limit of 0.5. Our results demonstrate that the quantum property of photons remains even after transmission through unstable free-space channels, indicating the feasibility and potential application of free-spacebased quantum interference in quantum information processing. c 2022 Optica Publishing Group © 2022 OSA - The Optical Society.

Herein, a large area and uniform topological insulator bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) layer with high crystalline quality is directly epitaxial grown on GaAs(111)B wafer using a molecular beam epitaxy process, ensuring efficient out-of-plane carriers transportation due to reduced interface defects influence. By tiling monolayer graphene (Gr) on the as-prepared Bi2Te3 layer, a Gr/Bi2Te3/GaAs heterojunction array prototype was further fabricated, and our photodetector array exhibited the capability of sensing ultrabroad photodetection wavebands from visible (405 nm) to mid-infrared (4.5 μm) with a high specific detectivity (D*) up to 1012 Jones and a fast response speed at about microseconds at room temperature. The enhanced device performance can be attributed to enhanced light-matter interaction at the high-quality heterointerface of Bi2Te3/GaAs and improved carrier collection efficiency through graphene as a charge collection medium, indicating an application prospect of topological insulator Bi2Te3 for fast-speed broadband photodetection up to a mid-infrared waveband.

This is because the quantum yield of HO• from HOCl (ϕHO•, 254 = 1.4) is greater than the one from OCl- (ϕHO•, 254 = 0.278) by approximately 5 times. Moreover, chlorine photolysis in acidic mediums also tends to have lower radical quenching rates than that of their alkaline counterparts by up to 1000 times. The aim of this research is to investigate the applicability of the UV/Cl2 process by assessing its efficacy on the removal of trimethoprim (TMP) at not only acidic to neutral conditions (pH 6-7), but also alkaline mediums (pH 8-9). At alkaline pH, free chlorine exists as OCl- and since OCl- has a higher molar absorption coefficient as compared to HOCl at higher wavelengths, there would be higher reactive chlorine species (RCS) formation and contribution. TMP removal followed pseudo-first order kinetics and depicted that a maximum fluence based constant (kf′ = 0.275 cm2/mJ) was obtained using 42.25 μM (3 mg/L) of chlorine at pH 9, with an irradiation of 275 nm. At alkaline conditions, chlorine photolysis performance followed the trend of UV (275)/Cl2 &gt; UV (265)/Cl2 &gt; UV (310)/Cl2 &gt; UV (254)/Cl2. RCS like Cl•, Cl2−• and ClO• contributed to the degradation of TMP. When the pH was increased from 6 to 8, contribution from hydroxyl radicals (HO• ) was decreased whilst that of RCS was increased. Application of UV (310)/Cl2 had the highest HO• generation, contributing to TMP removals up to 13% to 48% as compared to 5% to 27% in UV (254, 265, 275)/Cl2 systems at pH 6-9. Artificial neural networks modelling was found to be able to verify and predict the contribution of HO• and RCS conventionally calculated via the general kinetic equations in the UV/Cl2 system at 254, 265, 275 and 310 nm. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152551,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121970220&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.152551&partnerID=40&md5=8bb1ec07e03f251fa06fe5ec4a9f6bdc,Article

The achievement of these tasks requires the navigation of vast and complex chemical and biological spaces, difficult to accomplish with reasonable speed. Using modern algorithms and supercomputers, quantum physics methods are able to examine systems containing a few hundred interacting species and determine the probability of finding them in a particular region of phase space, thereby anticipating their properties. Likewise, modern approaches in chemistry and biomolecular simulation, supported by high performance computing, have culminated in producing data sets of escalating size and intrinsically high complexity. Hence, using ML to extract relevant information from these fields is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of chemical and biomolecular systems. At the heart of ML approaches lie statistical algorithms, which by evaluating a portion of a given data set, identify, learn, and manipulate the underlying rules that govern the whole data set. The assembly of a quality model to represent the data followed by the predictions and elimination of error sources are the key steps in ML. In addition to a growing infrastructure of ML tools to address complex problems, an increasing number of aspects related to our understanding of the fundamental properties of biomacromolecules are exposed to ML. These fields, including those residing at the interface of polymer science and biology (i.e., structure determination, de novo design, folding, and dynamics), strive to adopt and take advantage of the transformative power offered by approaches in the ML domain, which clearly has the potential of accelerating research in the field of biomacromolecules. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

The most widely used growth plane for group III-nitride LEDs is the polar plane (c-plane), which is characterized by the presence of a polarization-induced internal electric field in heterostructures. It is possible to address long-standing problems in group III-nitride LEDs, by using semipolar and nonpolar orientations of GaN. In addition to the reduction in the polarization-induced internal electric field, semipolar orientations potentially offer the possibility of higher indium incorporation, which is necessary for the emission of light in the visible range. This is the preferred growth orientation for green/yellow LEDs and lasers. The important properties such as high output power, narrow emission linewidth, robust temperature dependence, large optical polarization ratio, and low-efficiency droop are demonstrated with semipolar LEDs. To harness the advantages of semipolar orientations, comprehensive studies are required. This review presents the recent progress on the development of semipolar InGaN/GaN quantum well LEDs. Semipolar InGaN LED structures on bulk GaN substrates, sapphire substrates, free-standing GaN templates, and on Silicon substrates are discussed including the bright prospects of group III-nitrides. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,10.1134/S0030400X2203002X,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135154880&doi=10.1134%2fS0030400X2203002X&partnerID=40&md5=2f99645ab8ba72a78b1f9104a4c786e7,Article

However, the large-scale performance of ground-based quantum networks (which employ photons as information carriers through optical fibers) is fundamentally limited by fiber quality and link length, with the latter being a primary design factor for practical network architectures. While these fundamental limits are well established for arbitrary network topologies, the question of how to best design global architectures remains open. In this work, we introduce a large-scale quantum network model called weakly regular architectures. Such networks are capable of idealizing network connectivity, provide freedom to capture a broad class of spatial topologies, and remain analytically treatable. This allows us to investigate the effectiveness of large-scale networks with consistent connective properties and unveil critical conditions under which end-to-end rates remain optimal.

The model is trained in a two-step multi-fidelity framework for high-accuracy forecast, using first a large amount of low-fidelity physical-model-generated synthetic data and then a small set of high-fidelity application-specific data. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the model is applicable to a wide range of resonances, including dielectric metasurfaces, graphene plasmonics and ultra-strongly coupled Landau polaritons, where our model captures small signal features and learns physical quantities.

(2022),2022,Remotely Establishing Polarization Entanglement over Noisy Polarization Channels,Physical Review Applied,"The faithful distribution of entanglement over noisy channels is a vital prerequisite for many quantum technological applications. Quantum information can be encoded in different degrees of freedom (DOF) of photons, where each encoding comes with its own advantages and disadvantages with respect to noise resilience and practicality in manipulation. In this work, we experimentally implement a deterministic entanglement purification protocol that allows us to faithfully distribute entanglement in one DOF over a noisy channel and then remotely transfer it to another DOF for manipulation. In particular, we distribute robust energy-time entanglement and transfer it to polarization entanglement at the communicating parties. The remotely obtained polarization state is independent of the polarization noise during distribution and reaches fidelities to a Bell state of up to 97.6%. Our scheme enables robust and efficient polarization entanglement distribution in the presence of arbitrary polarization noise, which is relevant for future large-scale quantum networks. © 2022 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.17.034009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126697845&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevApplied.17.034009&partnerID=40&md5=c490379173e5af3706b9e77d3262269d,Article

With the development of topological photonics and phononics, electromagnetic and mechanical wave transmission with simultaneous advantages, e.g., antireflection, broadband, and nondispersion characteristics, has been simultaneously realized. This outcome has greatly improved elastic wave manipulation performance in solids, which are important media for wireless communication. Here, using a plate phononic crystal (PnC), a dual-mode elastic topological insulator is theoretically designed and experimentally realized, and the quantum spin Hall effect is observed under a dual band. Using discrete Kekulé modulation to construct the PnC multidomain junction, dual-mode and dual-band Dirac vortexes, i.e., a type of topological corner state, are obtained in a single PnC. These transmitted and localized topological states have the same excellent properties as their antecedents, which are obtained with single-band materials. The implementation mechanisms are diverse and applicable to multiple modes and broad frequencies, offering antijamming, low-loss, high-efficiency, and high-capacity signal processing components.

(2022),2022,AKLT-States as ZX-Diagrams: Diagrammatic Reasoning for Quantum States,PRX Quantum,"From Feynman diagrams to tensor networks, diagrammatic representations of computations in quantum mechanics have catalyzed progress in physics. These diagrams represent the underlying mathematical operations and aid physical interpretation, but cannot generally be computed with directly. In this paper we introduce the ZXH-calculus, a graphical language based on the ZX-calculus, that we use to represent and reason about many-body states entirely graphically. As a demonstration, we express the one-dimensional (1D) AKLT-state, a symmetry protected topological state, in the ZXH-calculus by developing a representation of spins higher than 1/2 within the calculus. By exploiting the simplifying power of the ZXH-calculus rules we show how this representation straightforwardly recovers the AKLT matrix-product state representation, the existence of topologically protected edge states, and the nonvanishing of a string-order parameter. Extending beyond these known properties, our diagrammatic approach also allows us to analytically derive that the Berry phase of any finite-length 1D AKLT chain is π. In addition, we provide an alternative proof that the two-dimensional (2D) AKLT-state on a hexagonal lattice can be reduced to a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum-computing resource. Lastly, we build 2D higher-order topological phases diagrammatically, which we use to illustrate a symmetry-breaking phase transition. Our results show that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing and computing with physical states entirely graphically, paving the way to develop more efficient many-body algorithms and giving a novel diagrammatic perspective on quantum phase transitions. © 2022 authors.

It will offer a significant experience for everyone by enabling hyper-connectivity between people and everything. In addition, it is expected to extend mobile communication possibilities where earlier generations could not have developed. Several potential technologies are predicted to serve as the foundation of 6G networks. These include upcoming and current technologies such as post-quantum cryptography, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), enhanced edge computing, molecular communication, THz, visible light communication (VLC), and distributed ledger (DL) technologies such as blockchain. From a security and privacy perspective, these developments need a reconsideration of prior security traditional methods. New novel authentication, encryption, access control, communication, and malicious activity detection must satisfy the higher significant requirements of future networks. In addition, new security approaches are necessary to ensure trustworthiness and privacy. This paper provides insights into the critical problems and difficulties related to the security, privacy, and trust issues of 6G networks. Moreover, the standard technologies and security challenges per each technology are clarified. This paper introduces the 6G security architecture and improvements over the 5G architecture.

Ions play a crucial role in the structure of the surrounding network of water molecules as they can either weaken or strengthen it. Gaining a thorough understanding of the underlying forces from small clusters to bulk solutions is still challenging, which motivates further investigations. Through a systematic analysis of the interaction energies obtained from high-level electronic structure methodologies, we assessed various dispersion-corrected density functional approaches, as well as ab initio-based data-driven potential models for halide ion–water clusters. We introduced an active learning scheme to automate the generation of optimally weighted datasets, required for the development of efficient bottom-up anion–water models. Using an evolutionary programming procedure, we determined optimized and reference configurations for such polarizable and first-principles-based representation of the potentials, and we analyzed their structural characteristics and energetics in comparison with estimates from DF-MP2 and DFT+D quantum chemistry computations. Moreover, we presented new benchmark datasets, considering both equilibrium and non-equilibrium configurations of higher-order species with an increasing number of water molecules up to 54 for each F, Cl, Br, and I anions, and we proposed a validation protocol to cross-check methods and approaches. In this way, we aim to improve the predictive ability of future molecular computer simulations for determining the ongoing conflicting distribution of different ions in aqueous environments, as well as the transition from nanoscale clusters to macroscopic condensed phases. © 2022 by the authors.

(2022),2022,Branching quantum convolutional neural networks,Physical Review Research,"Neural-network-based algorithms have garnered considerable attention for their ability to learn complex patterns from very-high-dimensional data sets towards classifying complex long-range patterns of entanglement and correlations in many-body quantum systems, and towards processing high-dimensional classical data sets. Small-scale quantum computers are already showing potential gains in learning tasks on large quantum and very large classical data sets. A particularly interesting class of algorithms, the quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) could learn features of a quantum data set by performing a binary classification task on a nontrivial phase of quantum matter. Inspired by this promise, we present a generalization of QCNN, the ""branching quantum convolutional neural network,""or bQCNN, with substantially higher expressibility. A key feature of bQCNN is that it leverages midcircuit (intermediate) measurement results, realizable on several current quantum devices, obtained in pooling layers to determine which sets of parameters will be used in the subsequent convolutional layers of the circuit. This results in a ""branching""structure, which allows for a greater number of trainable variational parameters in a given circuit depth. This is of particular use in current-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, where circuit depth is limited by gate noise. We present an overview of the Ansatz structure and scaling and provide evidence of its enhanced expressibility compared with QCNN. Using artificially constructed large data sets of training states as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the existence of training tasks in which bQCNN far outperforms an ordinary QCNN. We provide an explicit example of such a task in the recognition of the transition from a symmetry protected topological to a trivial phase induced by multiple, distinct perturbations.

While several proof-of-principle experiments of quantum communication using such sources have been realized, most of them required large setups—often involving liquid helium infrastructure or bulky closed-cycle cryotechnology. In this work, we report on the first quantum key distribution (QKD) testbed using a compact benchtop quantum dot single-photon source operating at telecom wavelengths. The plug&play device emits single-photon pulses at O-band wavelengths (1321 nm) and is based on a directly fiber-pigtailed deterministically fabricated quantum dot device integrated into a compact Stirling cryocooler. The Stirling is housed in a 19 in. rack module including all accessories required for stand-alone operation. Implemented in a simple QKD testbed emulating the BB84 protocol with polarization coding, we achieve an multiphoton suppression of g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) = 0.10 ± 0.01 and a raw key rate of up to ( 4.72 ± 0.13 ) kHz using an external pump laser. In this setting, we further evaluate the performance of our source in terms of the quantum bit error ratios, secure key rates, and tolerable losses expected in full implementations of QKD while accounting for finite key size effects. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal settings for a two-dimensional temporal acceptance window applied on the receiver side, resulting in predicted tolerable losses up to 23.19 dB.

Exploring low-dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in 2D magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin-current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin-to-charge conversion. Thickness-, temperature-, and structure-dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology-enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin-current pulses.

In solid-state quantum dots (QDs), the gate voltages required to stabilize quantized charges are unique for each individual qubit, resulting in a high-dimensional control parameter space that must be tuned automatically. Machine learning techniques are capable of processing high-dimensional data—provided that an appropriate training set is available—and have been successfully used for autotuning in the past. In this paper, we develop extremely small feed-forward neural networks that can be used to detect charge-state transitions in QD stability diagrams. We demonstrate that these neural networks can be trained on synthetic data produced by computer simulations, and robustly transferred to the task of tuning an experimental device into a desired charge state. The neural networks required for this task are sufficiently small as to enable an implementation in existing memristor crossbar arrays in the near future.

TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies, featuring high qubit quality, coherence time, and qubit connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size and typically use a single trap architecture, which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress toward the next major milestone of 50–100 qubit TI devices, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50–100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology, and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Toward realizing QCCD-based TI systems with 50–100 qubits, we perform an extensive application-driven architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology, and operation implementation methods. To enable our study, we built a design toolflow, which takes a QCCD architecture’s parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability, and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions. With industry and academic efforts underway to build TI devices with 50–100 qubits, our insights have the potential to influence QC hardware in the near future and accelerate the progress toward practical QC systems. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

Here we implement a ‘multiplexed’ one-dimensional optical lattice clock, in which spatially resolved strontium atom ensembles are trapped in the same optical lattice, interrogated simultaneously by a shared clock laser and read-out in parallel. In synchronous Ramsey interrogations of ensemble pairs we observe atom–atom coherence times of 26 s, a 270-fold improvement over the measured atom–laser coherence time, demonstrate a relative instability of 9.7(4)×10−18/τ (where τ is the averaging time) and reach a relative statistical uncertainty of 8.9 × 10−20 after 3.3 h of averaging. These results demonstrate that applications involving optical clock comparisons need not be limited by the instability of the local oscillator. We further realize a miniaturized clock network consisting of 6 atomic ensembles and 15 simultaneous pairwise comparisons with relative instabilities below 3×10−17/τ, and prepare spatially resolved, heterogeneous ensemble pairs of all four stable strontium isotopes.

(2022),2022,Kalman filter-enabled parameter estimation for simultaneous quantum key distribution and classical communication scheme over a satellite-mediated link,Optics Express,"An accurate estimation of system parameters is of significance for the practical implementation of the simultaneous quantum key distribution and classical communication (SQCC) over a satellite-mediated link when considering the finite-size effect. In this paper, we propose a Kalman filter (KF)-enabled parameter estimation method for the SQCC over a satellite-mediated link. The fast and slow phase drift can be both estimated by using the improved vector KF carrier phase estimation algorithm, and thus the phase estimation error can be tracked in real time and be almost approximate to the theoretical mean square error limit. Taking advantage of the achieved phase estimation and the dual modulation of the SQCC scheme, the excess noise can be estimated with not only a higher precise but also a lower sacrificing rate of raw keys. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the SQCC in both the downlink and uplink in terms of the finite-size effect. As a comparison of the Mth-power algorithm, we find that the secret key rate and achievable zenith angle perform better by using the vector KF algorithm. It paves the way of practical implementations for the SQCC system. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement",,10.1364/OE.448045,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124483225&doi=10.1364%2fOE.448045&partnerID=40&md5=d0daa6c3433f7a99f6b051eac15b0ca8,Article

Therefore, CoFe2O4@CA (CA = citric acid) NPs are embedded within N-isopropylacrylamid (NIPAM) based microgels. The volume phase transition (VPT) of the magnetic microgels and the respective pure microgels is studied by dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic mobility measurements. The interaction between MNPs and microgel network is studied via magnetometry and AC-susceptometry using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The data show a significant change of the magnetic properties by crossing the VPT temperature (VPTT). The change is related to the increased confinement of the MNP due to the shrinking of the microgels. Modifying the microgel with hydrophobic allyl mercaptan (AM) affects the swelling ability and the magnetic response, i.e. the coupling of MNPs with the polymer matrix. Modeling the AC-susceptibility data results in an effective size distribution. This distribution represents the varying degree of constraint in MNP rotation and motion by the microgel network. These findings help to understand the interaction between MNPs and the microgel matrix to design multi responsive systems with tunable particle matrix coupling strength for future applications.

However, the networking feasibility of quantum constellation that combines satellite-to-ground accesses selection and inter-satellite routing is faced with a lack of research. In this paper, satelliteto-ground accesses selection is modeled as problems to find the longest paths in directed acyclic graphs. The inter-satellite routing is interpreted as problems to find a maximum flow in graph theory. As far as we know, the above problems are initially understood from the perspective of graph theory. Corresponding algorithms to solve the problems are provided. Although the classical discrete variable quantum key distribution protocol, i.e., BB84 protocol, is applied in simulation, the methods proposed in our paper can also be used to solve other secure key distributions. The simulation results of a low-Earth-orbit constellation scenario show that the Sun is the leading factor in restricting the networking.

A low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) technique was used to deposit epitaxial poly-SiGe thin films. The thin films were subjected to annealing after the deposition. Our research shows that the most optimal thin films can be obtained at 800◦C for 30 min annealing in the hydrogen atmosphere. Under a 3-µW/cm2 incident light (with a wavelength of 550 nm) and up to 27-V biased voltage, the APS with a n+-n-p-p+ alloy/SiO2/Si-substrate structure using the better annealed poly-SiGe film process showed improved performance by nearly 70%, 96% in responsivity, and 85% in quantum efficiency, when compared to the non-annealed APS.

(2022),2022,Recent Advances in First-Principles Based Molecular Dynamics,Accounts of Chemical Research,"First-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) and its quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) extensions are powerful tools to follow the real-time dynamics of a broad variety of systems in their ground as well as electronically excited states. The continued advances in computational power have enabled simulations of QM regions of larger sizes for more extended time scales. In addition, development of the parallel algorithms has boosted the performance of QM/MM methods even on existing computer architectures. In the case of density functional-based FPMD, systems of several hundreds to thousands of atoms can now be customarily simulated for tens to hundreds of picoseconds. In spite of this progress, the time scale limitations remain severe, especially when high-rung exchange-correlation functionals or high-level wave function based quantum mechanical methods are used. To ameliorate this, a large number of enhanced sampling methods have been introduced but most of the approaches that have been developed to increase the efficiency of FPMD based simulations sacrifice the real-time dynamics in favor of enhancing sampling. Here, we present some recent advances in boosting the efficiency of FPMD based simulations while keeping the full dynamic information. These include a highly efficient recent implementation of FPMD-based QM/MM simulations that not only enables fully flexible combinations of different electronic structure methods and force fields via a highly efficient communication library, it also fully exploits parallelism for both quantum and classical descriptions. The second type of acceleration methods we discuss is a large family of specially devised multiple-time-step algorithms that make use of suitable breakups of the total nuclear forces into fast components that can be calculated via lower level methods and slowly varying correction forces evaluated with a high-level method at long time intervals. The computational gain of this scheme mostly depends on the cost difference between the two methods and advantageous combinations can yield large speedups without compromising the accuracy of the high-level method. And finally, the third class of FPMD acceleration methods presented here are machine learning models to accelerated FPMD and their powerful combinations with multiple-time-step techniques. The combination of all the approaches enables substantial speedups of FPMD simulations of several orders of magnitude while fully preserving the real-time dynamics and accuracy. © 2022 The Authors.

However, due to the coupling effect of wind, wave, and current, its time series has strong nonlinear characteristics, so it is a great challenge to obtain accurate forecasting results. Therefore, considering the strong nonlinear of SHM time series, firstly, this paper decomposes the original time series into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMF) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technology and then establishes a hybrid deep learning network for each IMF based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) according to the characteristics of SHM time series. On this basis, the EMD-CNN-GRU (ECG) hybrid forecasting model of SHM is constructed by integrating a component forecasting model. Secondly, considering the difficulty of hyper-parameters selection of ECG model, this paper improves the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) based on quantum theory, designs the quantum coding rules of butterfly spatial position, establishes the optimization process of butterfly algorithm based on quantum coding, and then proposes the quantum butterfly optimization algorithm (QBOA). Finally, a hybrid forecasting approach integrating ECG and QBOA is proposed, namely ECG & QBOA. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach. A prediction experiment was carried out with the SHM data of a real ship. The results indicate that, compared with the other comparison models selected in this paper, ECG-based models have significant higher forecasting accuracy (with MAPE values of 10.86% and 12.69% in two experiments, respectively, and with significant accuracy improvement of at least 10% than other compared models), and the QBOA has obtained more appropriate hyper-parameters combination of ECG model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",,10.1007/s11071-021-07139-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123097196&doi=10.1007%2fs11071-021-07139-y&partnerID=40&md5=d1fb0de43ca15d4bc42ecbf1d18a4691,Article

As a multi-functional tree species, the leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus possess antihypertensive and hypoglycemic activities. However, the regulatory mechanism involved in the photosynthetic process of C. paliurus exposed to salinity has not yet been elucidated. In this study, the photosynthetic characteristics of C. paliurus seedlings, such as photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), and electron transfer rate (ETR), were investigated under different salt concentrations, while the metabolome and transcrip-tome analyses were conducted to unravel its molecular regulatory mechanisms. Salt stress not only significantly affected photosynthetic characteristics of C. paliurus seedlings, but also severely modified the abundance of metabolites (such as fumaric acid, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate) involved in central carbon metabolism, and the expression of photosynthetic genes. Through the co-expression network analysis, a total of 27 transcription factors (including ERFs, IDD, DOF, MYB, RAP) were identified to regulate photosynthetic genes under salt stress.

This SaaS-like service, like its ancestors, should be strategically distributed and managed over multiple cloud zones, while taking into account several constraints and conditions (e.g., sensitivity of BPaaS fragments, insecure and untrusted cloud zones, lack of resources, and workload changes). However, current BPaaS approaches are static, which means that they are no longer suitable to manage such enterprise-oriented cloud service model and to deal with the uncertain and dynamic nature of cloud availability zones. To fill this gap, we adopt a predictive BPaaS management strategy by proposing a model that forecasts the next-short time overload of cloud zones. These latter, as hosting environments for the managed BPaaS, are categorized as overloaded or underloaded, which triggers the migration of BPaaS fragments to high-performance cloud zones. The proposed neural network prediction model (called QGA-NN) is enhanced with a quantum genetic algorithm to optimize the prediction of cloud zones' overload. QGA-NN is evaluated using a BPaaS placement algorithm, which we defined as a triggered management operation.

The kT-factorized description of this process is also handled, along with the two-photon production of a quark, or a W± gauge boson pair. This toolbox may be used as a common framework for the definition of many other processes following this approach. Additionally, photoproduction and other photon induced processes are also considered, or being implemented.

Nature of problem: The simulation of central exclusive, and in particular two-photon induced processes is becoming increasingly topical given its potential source of contamination for electroweak studies and resonance searches at LHC and future colliders. However, most of simulation tools available are only accounting for the production of photons collinear to the incoming proton beams. Legacy codes such as LPAIR, have however shown their effectiveness in predicting such processes at LHC energies. Unfortunately, they are barely maintained nor maintainable with modern computing infrastructures. Solution method: CepGen provides a modern implementation of legacy photon-induced matrix elements (γγ→ℓ+ℓ−, and W+W−, with more to be added), including standard e+e−, or pp beams (both elastic and dissociative final beam states for the latter). For the modern implementation of LPAIR, it inherits from the former fine treatment of the low-|t| region accounting for a large fraction of the cross section. It also introduces a general wrapping framework to define new photon-induced and diffractive processes, either in C++ or in Fortran. This wrapper provides the kT factorization procedure for 2→4 process computation, and a highly flexible 2→N process placeholder. A user-defined taming of the matrix element is also included to study the effect of kinematic variables-dependent survival factors observed experimentally.

188,Scopus,Vardoyan et al. (2022),2022,On the quantum performance evaluation of two distributed quantum architectures,Performance Evaluation,"Distributed quantum applications impose requirements on the quality of the quantum states that they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations of quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in understanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum hardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and traditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world implementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades the quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two possible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum network. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in which the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The second corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions over two distinct devices. We model these architectures as continuous-time Markov chains and compare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled quantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that it takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an illustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for present-day device parameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications, and the other for network-heavy ones. We validate our analysis with the quantum network simulator NetSquid. Besides the detailed study of these architectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that connect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum quality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum technologies.

Partial radial distribution function for S-S pair and bond-angle distribution function for S-S-S triplet demonstrate crystalline behavior, while the same functions for Ag-Ag pair and Ag-Ag-Ag triplet demonstrate liquid-like behavior. Mean squared displacement of S atoms indicates absence of diffusion for sulfur atoms, while the same function for Ag atoms has linear form at large times that indicates presence of diffusion for this sort of atoms. Velocity autocorrelation functions for S atoms have oscillatory behavior, while for Ag atoms no oscillations are observed. Comparison of mean squared displacement for S atoms and diffusivity for Ag atoms is performed to other ab initio and classical simulations as well as experimental data and demonstrates good agreement in all the cases.

After its initial design, compatibility tests with legacy L-band systems, and functional demonstrations in the laboratory, the system is currently undergoing the standardization process of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, LDACS has not been demonstrated in flight yet. In this article, we present the first in-flight demonstration of LDACS, which took place in March and April 2019 in southern Germany and included four LDACS ground stations and one LDACS airborne station. We detail the experimental setup of the implemented LDACS ground and airborne stations together with the flight routes, the conducted experiments, and the frequency planning to ensure compatibility with legacy systems. In addition, we describe the demonstrated ATM applications and the security measures used to protect them. Based on the obtained measurement results, we evaluate the LDACS in-flight communication performance for the first time, including the achieved communication range, the measured end-to-end message latency, and the LDACS capability to provide quality of service by effectively prioritizing safety-relevant data traffic. Furthermore, we use the in-flight received signal power to assess the applicability of a theoretical path loss model. These flight trials contribute to the final steps in the development of LDACS by providing its in-flight communication performance and by demonstrating: first, its correct functionality in a realistic environment; second, its capability of supporting ATM applications and the advanced security measures that can be used to protect them; and third, its spectrum compatibility with legacy systems. We conclude that LDACS is ready to support ATM operations and that LDACS frequency planning can safeguard legacy systems successfully. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",,10.1109/TAES.2021.3111722,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107540195&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2021.3111722&partnerID=40&md5=55727297d93a8e609112d1f50f478f48,Article
191,Scopus,Lv et al. (2022),2022,Research Progress of Vortex Beam Laser (Invited) [涡旋光激光器研究进展(特邀)],Guangzi Xuebao/Acta Photonica Sinica,"The vortex beam laser outputs a high-energy and high-quality vortex beam, which is one typical structured light field. Vortex beam has potential applications in many important fields, such as optical communications, optical manipulation, precision measurement, quantum information, and superresolution imaging. Therefore, how to efficiently generate high quality vortex beam has attracted considerable interests of research in recent years. In this paper, we first briefly introduce the generation principle and main applications of the vortex beam. There are two main ways of generating vortex beams, i.e., active method and passive method. Compared with active method, passive method generally suffers from low conversion efficiency and poor beam quality (especially for high order vortex beams). When a high quality vortex beam is needed, active method is a better choice. The active method generates vortex beams under laser configuration. For example, the high purity vortex beam can be generated by using the mode selection of the laser cavity. At present, the research focus on vortex beam laser is to improve the laser performance and the mode purity of the output vortex beam. In addition, the integration of vortex beam laser, which facilitates various commercial applications, is also a hot topic. Then, we review the recent progress of vortex beam lasers, including solid-state vortex laser, vortex-beam optical parametric oscillator, fiber vortex laser and on-chip integrated vortex lasers. Solid-state vortex laser is one of the most common methods to generate a vortex beam. By properly designing various types of resonators, one can generate the desired laser vortex mode while suppressing the unwanted ones. Taking Laguerre-Gaussian beams as an example, one can use the pump shaping technique to transform the pump beam from a Gaussian beam to a ring shaped intensity profile, which can effectively enhance the gain of the matched Laguerre-Gaussian cavity mode and decrease the gain of other modes. In addition, a tilted etalon can also be used in the resonant cavity to precisely control the gain and loss of different cavity modes. A recent method is to add spatial phase modulation elements (such as spiral phase plate, vortex half-wave plate, and so on) into the cavity. By satisfying the polarization and spatial mode self-reproduction condition of the cavity mode, the output beam can carry a specific spiral phase, i.e., one can obtain a desired vortex laser beam. Interestingly, the use of spatial light modulators and metasurface greatly enriches the types of output spatial light beams. By loading different holograms on the spatial light modulators or properly designing the structures of the metasurfaces, one can get various types of vortex modes, including those with large l and p indices that are difficult to be produced in the previous methods. Along with the foundation of solid state vortex laser, other forms of vortex beam lasers have also been rapidly developed in recent years. Vortex beam parametric oscillator can achieve the output of vortex beam with a tunable wavelength by controlling the phase matching conditions. Compared with the solid state vortex laser, the output wavelength band of vortex beam is greatly expanded. The fiber vortex laser uses the fiber configuration to output vortex beam. The low cost and high stability of the fiber laser can be effectively combined with the vortex beam output for practical applications in high capacity information transmission. This unique characteristic makes fiber vortex laser particularly useful in the field of optical fiber communication. The development of micro/nano fabrication techniques make it possible to integrate vortex lasers on a chip. Finally, we present the prospects of the future development of the vortex beam laser. High conversion efficiency and high mode purity are two critical requirements for high end applications of vortex beam lasers. © 2022, Science Press.

Among the computational challenges with great interest in science and industry are the inversion problems. These kinds of numerical procedures can be described as the process of determining the cause of an event from measurements of its effects. In this paper, we apply a recursive quantum algorithm to a D-Wave quantum annealer to solve a small scale seismic inversions problem. We compare the obtained results from the quantum computer to those derived from a classical algorithm. The accuracy achieved by the quantum computer is at least as good as that of the classical computer.

(2022),2022,"Task Allocation among Connected Devices: Requirements, Approaches, and Challenges",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"Task allocation (TA) is essential when deploying application tasks to systems of connected devices with dissimilar and time-varying characteristics. The challenge of an efficient TA is to assign the tasks to the best devices, according to the context and task requirements. The main purpose of this article is to study the different connotations of the concept of TA efficiency, and the key factors that most impact on it, so that relevant design guidelines can be defined. This article first analyzes the domains of connected devices where TA has an important role, which brings to this classification: 1) Internet of Things (IoT); 2) sensor and actuator networks (SANs); 3) multirobot systems (MRSs); 4) mobile crowdsensing (MCS); and 5) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This article then demonstrates that the impact of the key factors on the domains actually affects the design choices of the state-of-the-art TA solutions. It results that resource management has most significantly driven the design of TA algorithms in all domains, especially IoT and SAN. The fulfillment of coverage requirements is important for the definition of TA solutions in MCS and UAV. Quality of Information requirements are mostly included in MCS TA strategies, similar to the design of appropriate incentives. This article also discusses the issues that need to be addressed by future research activities, i.e., allowing interoperability of platforms in the implementation of TA functionalities; introducing appropriate trust evaluation algorithms; the list of tasks performed by objects; and designing TA strategies where network service providers have a role in TA functionalities' provisioning. © 2014 IEEE.",,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3127314,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119415759&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3127314&partnerID=40&md5=4ca96cb3a2ed24ab3a4ec793872912d2,Article

(2022),2022,Magnetic Interactions Between Radical Pairs in Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons,Nano Letters,"Open-shell graphene nanoribbons have become promising candidates for future applications, including quantum technologies. Here, we characterize magnetic states hosted by chiral graphene nanoribbons (chGNRs). The substitution of a hydrogen atom at the chGNR edge by a ketone effectively adds one pz electron to the π-electron network, producing an unpaired π-radical. A similar scenario occurs for regular ketone-functionalized chGNRs in which one ketone is missing. Two such radical states can interact via exchange coupling, and we study those interactions as a function of their relative position, which includes a remarkable dependence on the chirality, as well as on the nature of the surrounding ribbon, that is, with or without ketone functionalization. Besides, we determine the parameters whereby this type of system with oxygen heteroatoms can be adequately described within the widely used mean-field Hubbard model. Altogether, we provide insight to both theoretically model and devise GNR-based nanostructures with tunable magnetic properties. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c03578,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122284344&doi=10.1021%2facs.nanolett.1c03578&partnerID=40&md5=a1c5245743a1126f04563f8695c2ccb0,Article
195,Scopus,Salari et al. (2022),2022,Are Brain–Computer Interfaces Feasible With Integrated Photonic Chips?,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"The present paper examines the viability of a radically novel idea for brain–computer interface (BCI), which could lead to novel technological, experimental, and clinical applications. BCIs are computer-based systems that enable either one-way or two-way communication between a living brain and an external machine. BCIs read-out brain signals and transduce them into task commands, which are performed by a machine. In closed loop, the machine can stimulate the brain with appropriate signals. In recent years, it has been shown that there is some ultraweak light emission from neurons within or close to the visible and near-infrared parts of the optical spectrum. Such ultraweak photon emission (UPE) reflects the cellular (and body) oxidative status, and compelling pieces of evidence are beginning to emerge that UPE may well play an informational role in neuronal functions. In fact, several experiments point to a direct correlation between UPE intensity and neural activity, oxidative reactions, EEG activity, cerebral blood flow, cerebral energy metabolism, and release of glutamate. Therefore, we propose a novel skull implant BCI that uses UPE. We suggest that a photonic integrated chip installed on the interior surface of the skull may enable a new form of extraction of the relevant features from the UPE signals. In the current technology landscape, photonic technologies are advancing rapidly and poised to overtake many electrical technologies, due to their unique advantages, such as miniaturization, high speed, low thermal effects, and large integration capacity that allow for high yield, volume manufacturing, and lower cost. For our proposed BCI, we are making some very major conjectures, which need to be experimentally verified, and therefore we discuss the controversial parts, feasibility of technology and limitations, and potential impact of this envisaged technology if successfully implemented in the future.

196,Scopus,Norouzi et al. (2022),2022,Quantum Audio Steganalysis Based on Quantum Fourier Transform and Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing","In recent years, researchers have considered quantum steganography and its various methods with the development and progress of research in computation theory and quantum signals processing. The destructive use of quantum steganography methods to establish illegal covert communications is rising, so it is essential to introduce ways to detect hidden data in a quantum medium. Accordingly, this paper presents a frequency-based universal audio steganalysis approach to detecting quantum steganography. First, based on the quantum Fourier transform, the characteristic of the quantum spectrum centroid (QSC) was computed, and its circuit network was implemented to extract feature vectors. The proposed method classifies quantum audio signals using a quantum machine learning approach called a quantum ensemble of quantum classifiers. This approach was implemented within the framework of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, which uses the superposition property to create an ensemble of classifiers evaluated in parallel, significantly increasing the computational speed. The accuracy weight of the classifiers is adjusted based on the classifiers' performance in training data classification; finally, the measurement of the first n qubits of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm predicts whether the quantum audio signals belong to the stego or clean class. The idea stems from the classic ensemble methods that try to build more robust models by combining different classifiers. The results show that the proposed frequency domain steganalysis method with 95% accuracy performs better than the previous methods in the time domain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s00034-022-02208-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140964218&doi=10.1007%2fs00034-022-02208-y&partnerID=40&md5=18b8fe68d896d8b52eaecc9ec97cb6a2,Article

Journal: Electromagnetic Biology and MedicineDOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/15368378.2022.2065682 The published version of the above mentioned article has been revised. The changes are mentioned below: Updated Introduction section: As it is known, the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2011 classified radiofrequency radiations (RFRs) as possible carcinogen (2B) to humans, opening this field for further investigation (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2011). However, we have very limited information on the relation between microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), fatty acids in brain and RFRs, which is very important to understand the effects of electromagnetic pollution emitted by all wireless equipment that is uncontrolled and widely used in our daily life. In our previous works we indicated that long term and excessive use of 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz RFR radiofrequency radiation altered microRNA expression in brain (Dasdag et al., 2015a; 2015b). We investigated the effects of 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz RFR on some miRNAs namely, rno-miR-9-5p, rno-miR-29a-3p, rno-miR-106b-5p, rno-miR-107 and rno-miR-125a-3p in brain. In the 900 MHz exposure study, rats were exposed to 900 MHz RF radiation for 3 h per day (7 days a week) for 12 months (one year) in the exposure group and we found that 900 MHz RFR exposure only decreased rno-miR107 expression (Dasdag et al., 2015a). In the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi exposure study, rats were exposed to 2.4 GHz RFRs emitted from Wi Fi generator for 24 hours a day for 12 months (one year) in the exposure group and we found that one-year exposure of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi radiation altered expression of some miRNAs such as rno-miR-106b-5p and rno-miR-107. The results of this study indicated that rno-miR-107 expression was 3.3 times and rno-miR-106b-5p expression was 3.65 times lower in the exposure group than the control group (Dasdag et al., 2015b).We also investigated the effects of 900 MHz RFR with same exposure setup on ten miRNAs in 2019 and found that chronic exposure of RFR under investigation has potential to increase expression of rno-miR-145-5p (Dasdag et al., 2019). Kumar R et al. (2021) exposed rats to 900 (5.84 × 10–4 W/kg), 1800 (5.94 × 10–4 W/kg) and 2.4 GHz (6.4 × 10–4 W/kg) RFRs for 2h/d for one, three and six-months and stated that “900–2450 MHz exposure led to hypermethylation of histone (H3K9) protein by upregulating euchromatic histone methyltransfer-ase1 enzyme, whereas hypomethylation of DNA (5-Mc) by down-regulating DNA methyltransferase1 enzyme with increasing microwave frequency as well as exposure duration of Wistar rat” (Kumar et al., 2021). Another important parameter in terms of electromagnetic pollution is the relation between RFR exposure and membrane fatty acids, which we have also very limited knowledge in this field. It is stated that “pain sensation can be changed upon the effect of extremely weak chemical and physical signals, having intensity even less than thermal threshold and non-linear dose-dependent character. Therefore, such a cellular target must have a quantum-mechanical nature” Ayrapetyan S (2018). However, Dutta et al indicated that “RFR affects both calcium-ion release and acetylcholinesterase activity in nervous system-derived cells in culture in a common dose-dependent manner” Dutta et al (1992). As it is also reported, “primary target for non-thermal biological effects of weak intensity radiation, is skin water contents the dissociation molecules of which have quantum sensitive characters. The product of water molecules dissociation which forming ROS serve one of important messengers trough which circulating blood modulate the metabolism of different tissues. Since by fundamental work by Blackman et al in 1982 is known that in realization non-thermal effect of EHF EMF key role have Ca exchange which is involvement in great number of fundamental cell processes, such as Lipids exchange and nucleic acids metabolisms (Ziskin MC, 2006; Blackman et al (1982); Brini and Carafoli 2009)”. Sert et al. (2002) investigated the effect of 3 h/d exposure of the 0.8 mT magnetic field on the membrane fatty acids of testes and found that the fatty acid of the testis cell membrane phospholipids was decreased in the exposure group. It is similarly indicated that twenty minutes of 900 MHz RFR exposure (short term) do not alter the percentage of fatty acids in brain and testes (Dasdag et al. 2004, 2003). Recently, Oyarce et al. (2021) detected the main changes of some fatty acid, ergosterol and antioxidant activity of metabolites in the fungus Serpulahimantioide exposed to 2.5 GHz Wi-Fi exposure. They observed an increment in the content of some fatty acids and ergosterol and finally stated that “Direct exposure to Wi-Fi radiation produces oxidative damage by modifying cellular components in the fubgus S. himantioides” (Oyarce et al. 2021). If the World Health Organization (WHO) do not lead to put realistic educational and protective mechanisms, it is certain that human beings will continue to use wireless communication tools in incredible amounts and therefore will be exposed to more and more electromagnetic pollution with each passing day by ignoring health hazards. To draw attention to the subject, the aim of this study is to reveal the effects of long-term exposure of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi exposure on some miRNAs such as rno-miR- 22-3p, rno-miR-24-1- 3p, rno-miR-132-3p, rno-miR- 145-5p, rno-miR-181a-5p, rno-miR-186-5p, rno-miR- 195-5p, rno-miR-219a-5p, rno-miR-221-3p, rno-miR- 222-3p and fatty acids in brain tissue. Updated Exposure and field measurements section: A pulsed signal generator, which could output Wi-Fi signals at 2.45 GHz, was used in the exposure system. Sham (n= 8) and experimental group animals (n= 8) were maintained free in their respective plexiglass cages to resume their daily activities without any restrictions. The experimental group, however, were exposed to 2.45 GHz RFR, about 50 cm below the transmitting antenna of the signal generator, every day (24 h/d) for one year. Similar to experimental group, animals in the control group lived 50 cm below the antenna of the generator (24h/d) for one year, except the generator was turned off. At the end of last exposure, the rats were intraperitoneally administered a combination of 6 mg/kg of 2% xylazine hydrochloride (Rompun) and 75 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride (Ketalar) for anesthesia. Afterward, the brain of each rat were removed for the analysis. Experiment setup is displayed in Fig. 1. Electromagnetic power density and the electrical field inside the Plexiglas cage were measured at several points using a field probe EMR 300 (NARDA, Pfullingen, Germany). To minimize coupling from unwanted radiation sources, four sides of the cage were covered with electromagnetic pyramidal absorber backed by metal sheets to isolate the test setup. Page 10, Part of Discussion section: As it is discussed above, we investigate the effect of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi exposure on ten different microRNAs such as rno-miR-22-3p, rno-miR-24-1- 3p, rno-miR-132-3p, rno-miR-145-5p, rno-miR -181a-5p, rno-miR-186-5p, rno-miR-195-5p, rno-miR-219a-5p, rno-miR-221-3p and, rno-miR-222- 3p in this study. However, we observed that 2.4 GHz RFR only increased rno-miR-181a-5p expression, which is stated that “miR-181a-5p increased the chemical sensitivity of HS578T cells to cisplatin by inhibiting VDR to promote autophagy” (Lin et al. 2021). Therefore, we can state that our previous studies supported the results of this study in terms of indicating the effects of RFRs on miRNA. miR-181a-5p was highly expressed in serum of acute ischemic injury patients” (Song et al., 2021). On the other hand, Liu et al. stated that “miR-181a-5p is a miRNA shown to play an essential role in multiple cancers, such as hepatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and human diseases, such as osteoarthritis. The interaction between lncRNA CCAT1 and miR-181a-5p has been demonstrated in endometrial carcinoma” (Liu et all. 2020). New paragraph at the end of Discussion section: On the other hand, It is interestingly reported that “electronically generated electromagnetic fields are coherent, producing very high electric and magnetic forces, which act on the voltage sensor of voltage-gated calcium channels to produce increases in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i” (Pall. 2022). Blaustein and Lederer reported that “In controlling of intracellular Ca homoesis have key role cGMP-dependent Ca efflux from the cell, which realized by Na/Ca exchange in forward(F) mode and Ca-pump in cell membrane and cAMP-Ca exchange in/Ca exchange in reverse (R) mode”. They also stated that “the discovery of multiple Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes and gene products, and multiple splice variants, as well as exchangers with different coupling ratios [i.e., the 3 Na+:1Ca2+ exchanger a Na2+/Ca2+ exchanger and the 4 Na+:(1Ca2+ +1K+) exchanger] has added to the complexity. We must even consider the possibility that some cells may express more than one Na+/Ca2+ exchanger [or Na+/(Ca2+ + K+) gene product or alternatively spliced isoform] and that these exchangers may perform different functions” (Blaustein and Lederer, 1999). By Ayrapetyan work have shown that in cell membrane have two family of quantum-sensitive receptors through which the non-thermal effect of non-ionizing radiation on cells are realized they are soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and G proteins family of receptors the activation of which leads to stimulate the cAMP –dependent RNa/Ca exchange (Ayrapetyan, 2018). Therefore we hypothesis that the non -thermal radioation-induced changes of physicochemical properties of circulating blood by stimulation of quantum-sensitive membrane receptors induced [Ca]i changes could be primary mechanism for modulation oflipids metabolisms and RNA metabolism. To check this hypothesis will be the aim of future works. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1080/15368378.2022.2088659,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140858106&doi=10.1080%2f15368378.2022.2088659&partnerID=40&md5=a8570774cc813c500825fc375beaad72,Erratum

200,Scopus,Choudhuri & Halder (2022),2022,Brain MRI tumour classification using quantum classical convolutional neural net architecture,Neural Computing and Applications,"The use of quantum machines leverages the performance of classical machines in many aspects of solving real-world problems. Classification of a brain MR image for detection of tumour regions is a widely performed diagnostic step when it comes to working with brain images. Classical machine learning methods and/or conventional deep learning architectures including convolutional nets are commonly used for the classification of images. With larger network size, training the model becomes a challenging task to undertake. Quantum algorithms are beneficial in optimizing the performance of classical algorithms by incorporating intrinsic properties of quantum bits. In this paper, a novel Quantum Classical ConvNet architecture (QCCNN) is proposed for a binary class classification of brain MR images for detection of tumour regions in the human brain. The underlying idea is to encode data into quantum states enabling a faster extraction of information followed by using the information to distinguish the class of data. The reliability and the robustness of the proposed architecture are highlighted by the results obtained by the classifier. With technological advancements in quantum computers in the future (more qubits and less noise), the performance of the approach can be further improved. The presented model is tested on various datasets (Brats 2013, Harvard Med School, private dataset) and on quantitative evaluation with standard metrics, and the robustness of the classifier is verified.

201,Scopus,Fontana et al. (2022),2022,Non-trivial symmetries in quantum landscapes and their resilience to quantum noise,Quantum,"Very little is known about the cost landscape for Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quantum Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum advantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Recent works have focused on quantum-aware optimizers specifically tailored for PQCs. However, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such optimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs: (1) We find an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large degeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast as an exponential reduction in the volume of relevant hyperparameter space. (2) We study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it is conserved under unital noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries and lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based on these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based Minima Hopping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our numerical simulations show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance in the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware. Overall, this work derives large-scale circuit symmetries from local gate transformations, and uses them to construct a noise-aware optimization method. © 2022 Quantum.

However, current protocols of pure-state informationally-complete (PS-IC) measurement settings generally involve various multi-qubit gates or complex quantum algorithms, which are not practical for large systems. In this study, we present an adaptive approach to N-qubit pure-state tomography with Pauli measurements. First, projective measurements on each qubit in the Z-direction were implemented to determine the amplitude of each base of the target state. Then, a set of Pauli measurement settings was recursively deduced by the Z-measurement results, which can be used to determine the phase of each base. The number of required measurement settings is O(N) for certain quantum states, including cluster and W states. Finally, we numerically verified the feasibility of our strategy by reconstructing a 1-D chain state using a neural network algorithm. © 2022 The Author(s).",,10.52396/JUSTC-2022-0037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140391190&doi=10.52396%2fJUSTC-2022-0037&partnerID=40&md5=c4e8c0db948688e0d10d441a2d278a0d,Article

204,Scopus,Ismail (2022),2022,Quantum Image Encryption Using a Self-Adaptive Hash Function-Controlled Chaotic Map (SAHF-CCM),IEEE Access,"Recently, quantum image encryption algorithms are attracting more and more attention, due to the upcoming quantum threat problem to the current cryptographic encryption algorithms with the rapid progress toward the quantum computer production. The aim of this paper is to introduce a self-adaptive encryption scheme to protect quantum image efficiently with minimal storage requirements. The methodology is to use two rounds of encryption with two different pseudorandom number sequences which are obtained from a new designed pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). This PRNG consists of two parts. The first part is based on iterating a recently proposed chaotic-based parallel keyed hash function which is used as a controller for a second part. The second part is a multiplication of Tent and Chebyshev chaotic maps (TCM). This combination of hash function and chaotic maps provides high randomness and a dramatical increase in the control parameters and initial values number which achieves extremely large key space and so makes the scheme stronger against brute force attacks. The seed or initial value of PRNG depends on the input image itself which makes the scheme self-adaptive and so it is stronger against chosen plaintext attacks and known-plaintext attacks. In the first round of encryption, the value of each pixel qubits of the input image is changed to a new value by XORing it with the corresponding qubits of the first pseudorandom sequence using CNOT and Toffoli quantum gates then shifting to the next qubit with the Swap quantum gate. In this round, the pixel value is changed. In the second round, diffusion of the changed pixel value is extended to each pixel in the input image using the second pseudorandom sequence and Toffoli quantum gates. The time complexity of the proposed scheme is less than many recently published quantum image encryption schemes. The scheme security analysis is discussed, and the experimental results proved that the scheme is robust, secure and efficient. © 2013 IEEE.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3212899,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139867772&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3212899&partnerID=40&md5=c978232ce9bca0b61968cb179fd5c8e7,Article

The working principle relies on cross-phase modulation (XPM) of the single photons with a 1550-nm pump pulse and is enhanced by a ring resonator. Two different designs of the primary switch element are theoretically studied, namely a ring resonator intensity switch (RRIS) based on resonance shifting due to XPM and a ring resonator phase switch (RRPS) acting as an all-optical phase shifter in a Mach&#x2013;Zehnder interferometer. As a novel approach to speed up the switching, chirped pre-emphasis and wipe sections for the pump pulses are utilized. A design tool is established from analytical expressions and serves as starting point for further optimization using a dedicated travelling-wave model (TWM). The TWM demonstrates the feasibility of both designs to be driven by either the proposed pre-emphasis pulse shape or a train of chirped Gaussian pulses. While the RRPS turns out to require less pump energy, its operation is more sensitive to pump-power fluctuations. Insertion losses below 0.1&#x00A0;dB and a power consumption below 5&#x00A0;nJ at 1&#x00A0;GHz switching rates for both configurations prove the potential of this concept for scalable quantum photonic applications.

Numerous decentralized blockchain applications have been possible due to blockchains' nature of distributed, secured, and peer-to-peer storage. One of its technical pillars is using public-key cryptography and hash functions, which promise a secure, pseudoanonymous, and distributed storage with nonrepudiation. This security is believed to be difficult to break with classical computational powers. However, recent advances in quantum computing have raised the possibility of breaking these algorithms with quantum computers, thus, threatening the blockchains' security. Quantum-resistant blockchains are being proposed as alternatives to resolve this issue. Some propose to replace traditional cryptography with postquantum cryptography-others base their approaches on quantum computer networks or quantum internets. Nonetheless, a new security infrastructure (e.g., access control/authentication) must be established before any of these could happen. This article provides a theoretical analysis of the quantum blockchain technologies that could be used for decentralized identity authentication. We put together a conceptual design for a quantum blockchain identity framework and give a review of the technical evidence.

In this context, high-bandwidth semiconductor-based mid-IR FSO transceivers will be desirable to meet the requirements of low energy consumption and small footprints for large-volume development and deployment.

In the conventional IR technology, PbS, HgCdTe are the standard materials, among others, in the specified regions with low dark current, high quantum efficiency, and fast response. Nevertheless, alternative materials have long been sought as conventional IR technology is associated with drawbacks such as low yield, complex fabrication steps, and high-cost. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are excellent candidates as they possess an inherent capacity for broad spectral tunability, solution processibility, and high-temperature operation. CQDs of semiconductor nanocrystals, such as PbS, mercury chalcogenide compounds, Ag2Te, are quantum confined in three dimensions and can be synthesized by simple wet inorganic chemical methods. This chapter describes the fundamental physics, properties of CQDs and the advantages of employing them for IR imaging against the conventional single-crystal counterparts. In the last two decades of research, CQDs have seen enormous progress in performance, and the detectivity of HgTe CQD photodetectors has reached values comparable to commercial interest. The evolution and present status of the CQDbased photodetectors in the infrared region has been reviewed, and their standard specifications are presented. Moreover, solution processing techniques are versatile and has enabled easy fabrication of various device architectures to help improve the device performance and achieve multiple functionalities. Many research groups have shown novel device architectures opening new opportunities for photoconductors, photodiodes, and phototransistors.

Researchers have formulated and executed a plethora of bug forecasting methodologies by computing the performance in terms of precision and difficulty. Various statistical models are established in the literature to observe bug existence and restoring method; these models are termed software reliability growth models. The existence of bugs in software is primarily because of the constant variations in the software code. Open source software is prevalent amongst academicians and has found users in big businesses. OSS is extremely effective, but source code variations have to be made regularly through the progressively advanced requirement at the user’s end. The open source group is expanding rapidly, and numerous categories of provisions are offered. Stakeholders contribute to OSS in business by reinforcing the value of schemes, taking into account great revenue earnings and novel scheme expansion. An essential feature of open source software is determining when to issue a novel form. The principal goal is to announce the software at a suitable time with minimal economic restrictions. The approach after announcing software is a challenge and announcement development performs a vital function in handling effective announcements to clients. It is essentially a group of novel characteristics that are combined to form an invention setting. The primary announcement is just after the expansion procedure and additional consequent announcements are founded upon the preceding announcements, number of prerequisites, and faults restored. Each announcement incorporates a collection of characteristics fulfilling particular restrictions of the corporation as required by the customers. Forming conclusions about what characteristics are to be encompassed in which announcement is a tiresome job. Information theory, which deals with computation and communication of knowledge around a network, was primarily invented by Claude E Shannon. It is a probabilistic established method that emphasizes the computation of vagueness associating data. It has widespread prospective functions in areas including model recognition, statistical interpretation, natural language processing, thermal physics, quantum computing, etc. Entropy is a significant subdivision of information theory that performs a principal function in examining the code change procedure. It is a quantity of uncertainty/difficulty of code change and portrays the quantity of information covered in an event. In this chapter, a method of captivating the number of faults documented in numerous announcements of Bugzilla software is established and distinctive amounts of entropy for the alterations in various software, which informs these intervals, are computed. Initially simple linear regression is employed to envisage faults that are expected to occur in the future.

It is a potential candidate for application in Sixth-Generation (6G) 6GSixth-Generation wireless networks, as it has the capabilities of satisfying the high data rate and capacity requirements of future wireless communication systems. Profound knowledge of the propagation channel is crucial in communication systems design, which nonetheless is still at its infancy, as channel modeling at THz frequencies has been mostly limited to characterizing fixed Point-to-Point (PtP) scenarios up to 300 GHz. Provided the technology matures enough and models adapt to the distinctive characteristics of the THz wave, future wireless communication systems will enable a plethora of new use cases and applications to be realized, in addition to delivering higher spectral efficiencies that would ultimately enhance the Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the end user. In this paper, we provide an insight into THz channel propagation characteristics, measurement capabilities, and modeling techniques for 6G communication applications, along with guidelines and recommendations that will aid future characterization efforts in the THz band. We survey the most recent and important measurement campaigns and modeling efforts found in literature, based on the use cases and system requirements identified.

Methods for TCP have emerged greatly with the development of machine learning. However, TCP is always a challenging work due to the dynamic characteristics of traffic data and the complex structure of traffic network. This paper presents a new quantum algorithm that can capture temporal and spatial features of traffic data simultaneously for TCP. The algorithm consists of the following steps. First, we give a closed-form solution in the Schr&#x00F6;dinger approach theoretically to analyze this TCP problem in time dimension. Then we can get the temporal features from the solution. At last, we construct a quantum graph convolutional network and apply temporal features into it. Thus, the temporal-spatial quantum graph convolutional neural network is proposed. The feasibility of this method is proved through experiments on the simulation platform. The experimental results show the average error rate is 0.21 and can resist perturbation effectively.

At the same time, state-of-the-art RL algorithms require a large computational budget in terms of training time to converge. Recent work has started to approach this problem through the lens of quantum computing, which promises theoretical speed-ups for several traditionally hard tasks. In this work, we examine a class of hybrid quantum-classical RL algorithms that we collectively refer to as variational quantum deep Q-networks (VQ-DQN). We show that VQ-DQN approaches are subject to instabilities that cause the learned policy to diverge, study the extent to which this afflicts reproducibility of established results based on classical simulation, and perform systematic experiments to identify potential explanations for the observed instabilities. Additionally, and in contrast to most existing work on quantum reinforcement learning, we execute RL algorithms on an actual quantum processing unit (an IBM Quantum Device) and investigate differences in behaviour between simulated and physical quantum systems that suffer from implementation deficiencies. Our experiments show that, contrary to opposite claims in the literature, it cannot be conclusively decided if known quantum approaches, even if simulated without physical imperfections, can provide an advantage as compared to classical approaches. Finally, we provide a robust, universal and well-tested implementation of VQ-DQN as a reproducible testbed for future experiments. © 2022 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.jfranklin.2022.08.021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137411301&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfranklin.2022.08.021&partnerID=40&md5=efc4e115c9b41beb4f1e867161fdf6d9,Article

In this scenario, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be employed to enhance the capacity of quantum information processing and to distribute quantum entanglement in an efficient and scalable way with multiple users. Here, a method for realizing a multiplexed continuous variable (CV) quantum entanglement distribution based on a four-wave mixing process combined with an active routing technique is experimentally demonstrated.

233,Scopus,Skolik et al. (2022),2022,Quantum agents in the Gym: a variational quantum algorithm for deep Q-learning,Quantum,"Quantum machine learning (QML) has been identified as one of the key fields that could reap advantages from near-term quantum devices, next to optimization and quantum chemistry. Research in this area has focused primarily on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and several proposals to enhance supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with VQAs have been put forward. Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents’ success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy gradient RL can be extended to inferring optimal Q-values in restricted families of environments. This work paves the way towards new ideas on how a quantum advantage may be obtained for real-world problems in the future. © 2022 The authors.",,10.22331/Q-2022-05-24-720,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136886779&doi=10.22331%2fQ-2022-05-24-720&partnerID=40&md5=0357f82ece9ce32cfb9403ae30932ed8,Article

(2022),2022,Magnetically controlled anisotropic light emission of DNA-functionalized supraparticles,MRS Bulletin,"Abstract: In this article, we show the DNA-functionalization of supraparticles, form their network, and manipulate the optical features of these networks by applying a magnetic field. We start with preparing the supraparticles (SPs) of semiconducting InP/ZnSeS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), plasmonic silver nanoparticles, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. These SPs are prepared by employing azide-functionalized amphiphilic diblock or triblock copolymers as well as by using their combinations. Subsequently, we attached single-stranded DNAs to these SPs by employing copper-free click chemistry. Next, we hybridized DNA-coated QD SPs with the iron oxide SPs and formed a network. By applying a magnetic field, we restructured this network such that the iron oxide SPs are aligned. This led to an anisotropic emission from the QD SPs with a polarization ratio of 1.9. This study presents a proof-of-concept scheme to control the optical features of a self-assembled supraparticle system using an external interaction. We believe that our work will further contribute to the utilization of smart self-assembly techniques in optics and photonics. Impact statement: The self-assembly of the nanoparticles, which lies at the heart of this article, enables achieving unconventional physical responses that cannot be obtained by the individual nanomaterials. Therefore, controlling the self-assembly process can lead to unprecedented control over the mechanical, optical, or electronic features of such novel architectures made of various types of nanoparticles. This smart self-assembly process will undoubtedly enable the realization of novel applications and open new avenues in materials science and engineering. In this article, we employ the self-assembly in two different aspects. First, we self-assembled magnetic, plasmonic, and semiconducting nanoparticles to obtain their supraparticles with the help of various amphiphilic polymers. Next, single-stranded DNA molecules were attached to them for the first time to achieve a precise control over their physical forming a “network of supraparticles of nanoparticles.” As a proof-of concept demonstration, we hybridized DNA-functionalized magnetic supraparticles made of iron oxide nanoparticles and DNA-functionalized light-emitting supraparticles containing InP/ZnSe/ZnS quantum dots. We explored the potential of tailoring the emission characteristics of the emitted light by utilizing an external magnetic field. We observed that under an external magnetic field the hybrid network reshapes; as a result, the polarization of the emitted light can be changed such that polarization anisotropy reaches ~1.9. We believe that our work presented here can initiate advanced-level active polarization control in displays and other light-emitting devices in the future. Considering that LCD-based displays require polarized light to function, the results of this work may serve for realizing efficient polarizer-free displays that rely on the manipulation of the structure under the magnetic field.

This issue can now be addressed by a novel photonic tool, the quantum memristor,1 which displays a nonlinear behavior, while preserving quantum coherence, through a weak controlled interaction of its input state with the environment. Here, we show how its operation can be extended to deal with higher frequency modulations of the input and, possibly, with a simplification in its scheme. This method can prove useful for the future implementation of memristor-based quantum neural networks. © 2022 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2631512,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136139844&doi=10.1117%2f12.2631512&partnerID=40&md5=b29af57f6e8db4de414f81f163ce8637,Conference Paper

The acceleration can be boosted by pooling compute infrastructures to either parallelize algorithm execution or solve bigger instances that are not feasible on a single quantum computer, which requires an underlying Quantum Internet: the interconnection of quantum computers by quantum links and repeaters to exchange entangled quantum bits. However, Quantum Internet research so far has been focused on provisioning point-to-point flows only, which is suitable for (e.g.) quantum sensing and metrology, but not for distributed quantum computing. In this paper, after a primer on quantum computing and networking, we investigate the requirements and objectives of smart computing on distributed nodes from the perspective of quantum network provisioning.

To mitigate the market risks and make the best of investments, predicting the movement of stock index futures is considered significant to ensure the potential gain in futures market trading. However, the accurate and precise prediction is not easy to obtain in the financial data which normally have high fluctuation. While the conventional econometric methods for forecasting require many assumptions, the machine learning models generally involve complex and unintelligible rules as well as a complicated network structure. In addition, the machine learning model itself did not guarantee a global optimum solution. It easily falls to the local optimum answer that directly affects the model's predicted value accuracy. To handle these drawbacks, in this study, we propose using a novel hybrid Wavelet Transformation-Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WT-QPSO-ANFIS) model to forecast stock index futures. Generally speaking, three approaches, Wavelet Transformation (WT), Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), are combined in our forecasting model. The result reveals that the hybrid WT-QPSO-ANFIS model provides higher efficiency and accuracy in predicting all 11 stock index futures considered in this study compared to the conventional Sugeno-type ANFIS model, ANN model and ARIMA model in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Standard Error of Mean (SEM). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-030-97273-8_27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135527849&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-97273-8_27&partnerID=40&md5=6cdaa3b31caca318b1c04db0a8dfbec6,Book Chapter

As one of the essential components of optical routers, an optical switch can fast transmit or block the optical signal. However, most of the integrated optical switches reported to date rely on thermo-, magneto-, or electro-optical effects, which limit applications due to slow response times, large footprint, and complexity fabrication. Here, an integrated nonlinear optical switch designed by the inverse-design method and fabricated on the SiN platform is introduced. The integrated optical switch is demonstrated with significant intensity-dependent transmission at 1.5 µm waveband. The polarization-depended capability is explored by using fundamental polarized lights (transverse electric and transverse magnetic, respectively), which exhibits opposite transmission change trends during the whole power range and opens potential applications such as photonic quantum information processing. In order to address the saturation of Kerr-nonlinearity in SiN materials at high power, a MoS2/SiN hybrid integrated optical switch is fabricated by uniformly cladding few-layer MoS2 on the surface of inverse-designed region. That is demonstrated to enhance the nonlinear optical response of device efficiently and achieve more excellent switching capability at high power. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",,10.1002/lpor.202200254,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135509732&doi=10.1002%2flpor.202200254&partnerID=40&md5=76662a50941ccc69b6c5d43aae9d0d9d,Article

(2022),2022,An Evolutionary Pathway for the Quantum Internet Relying on Secure Classical Repeaters,IEEE Network,"Until quantum repeaters become mature, quantum networks remain restricted either to limited areas of directly connected nodes or to nodes connected to a common node. We circumvent this limitation by conceiving quantum networks using secure classical repeaters combined with the quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) principle, which is a compelling form of quantum communication that directly transmits information over a quantum channel. The final component of this promising solution is our classical quantum-resistant algorithm. Explicitly, in these networks, the ciphertext gleaned from a quantum-resistant algorithm is transmitted using QSDC along the nodes, where it is read out by one node and then transmitted to the next node. At the repeaters, the information is protected by our quantum-resistant algorithm, which is secure even in the face of a quantum computer. Hence, our solution offers secure end-to-end communication across the entire network, since it is capable of both eavesdropping detection and prevention in the emerging quantum Internet. It is compatible with operational networks, and will enjoy the compelling services of the popular Internet, including authentication. Hence, it smoothens the transition from the classical Internet to the quantum Internet (Qinternet) by following a gradual evolutionary upgrade. It will act as an alternative network in quantum computing networks in the future. We have presented the first experimental demonstration of a secure classical-repeater-based hybrid quantum network constructed by a serial concatenation of an optical fiber and free-space communication link.

(2022),2022,A Survey on Technologies Which Make Bitcoin Greener or More Justified,IEEE Access,"According to recent estimates, one bitcoin transaction consumes as much energy as 1.5 million Visa transactions. Why is bitcoin using so much energy? Most of the energy is used during the bitcoin mining process, which serves at least two significant purposes: a) distributing new cryptocurrency coins to the cryptoeconomy and b) securing the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. In reality, the comparison of bitcoin transactions to Visa transactions is not that simple. The amount of transactions in the Bitcoin network is not directly connected to the amount of bitcoin mining power nor the energy consumption of those mining devices; for example, it is possible to multiply the number of bitcoin transactions per second without increasing the mining power and the energy consumption. Bitcoin is not only 'digital money for hackers'. It has very promising future potential as a global reserve currency and a method to make the World Wide Web (WWW) immune to cyberattacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks. This survey approached cryptocurrencies' various technological and environmental issues from many different perspectives. To make various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), greener and more justified, what technological solutions do we have? We found that cryptocurrency mining might be cleaner than is generally expected. There is also a plan to make a vast renewable energy source available by combining Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and Bitcoin mining. There are plans to use unconventional computing methods (quantum computing, reversible computing, ternary computing, optical computing, analog computing) to solve some of the issues regarding the vast energy consumption of conventional computing (including cryptocurrency mining). We think using spare computing cycles for grid computing efforts is justified. For example, there are billions of smartphones in the world. Many smartphones are being recharged every day. If this daily recharging period of twenty to sixty minutes would be used for grid computing, for example, finding new cures to cancer, it would probably be a significant breakthrough for medical research simulations.

Simply put, IoV systems are vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) enhanced by integrating them with automation over the internet. As briefly discussed in this paper, the IoV systems guarantee various advantages like a much safer and more efficient future. However, the primary challenge at hand is implementing IoV at the end-user level. Of the varied building blocks present on the road to the development of IoV, secure data transfer is an essential requirement, especially with recent advances in quantum computing. IOTA is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) specifically designed to secure IoT data transmissions. This paper discusses the advantages of implementing IOTA for secure and private IoV systems. The paper suggests replacing IOTA's current post-quantum signature scheme Winternitz One Time Signature (W-OTS) with CRYSTALS Dilithium. These two post-quantum signature schemes are evaluated against each other to establish that employing Dilithium reduces both latency and signature space required, bringing a significant improvement to IOTA. This improvisation is beneficial, especially for the fast-paced functioning of IoV environments. © 2022 IEEE.",,10.1109/ICIBT52874.2022.9807757,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134373901&doi=10.1109%2fICIBT52874.2022.9807757&partnerID=40&md5=5d0810bea4f9df324e02db0954c0f5eb,Conference Paper

Researchers have developed algorithms that allow quantum computers to hack into information security concepts that were previously considered difficult, if not impossible, including asymmetric key cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography. Studies have been done to focus on improving security protocols through quantum computing to counter these vulnerabilities. One such focus is on the topic of quantum authentication (QA). However, while several QA protocols have been theorized, only a few have been implemented and further tested. Among the protocols, we selected and implemented five quantum authentication protocols to determine their feasibility in a real-world setting.

(2022),2022,Advancing the Security of LDACS,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,"The &#x201C;Single European Sky&#x201D; air traffic management master plan foresees the introduction of several modern digital data links for aeronautical communications. The candidate for long-range continental communications is the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS). LDACS is a cellular, ground-based digital communications system for flight guidance and communications related to safety and regularity of flight. Hence, the aeronautical standards, imposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for cybersecurity of the link and network layer, apply. In previous works, threat-and risk analyses of LDACS were conducted, a draft for an LDACS cybersecurity architecture introduced, algorithms proposed, and the security of a Mutual Authentication and Key Establishment (MAKE) procedure of LDACS formally verified. However, options for cipher-suites and certificate management for LDACS were missing. Also, previous works hardly discussed the topic of post-quantum security for LDACS. This paper proposes a cell-attachment procedure, which establishes a secure LDACS communication channel between an aircraft and corresponding ground-station upon cell-entry of the aircraft. Via the design of a hybrid LDACS Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the choice of a pre-or post-quantum Security Level (SL) is up to the communications participants. With that, this work introduces a full LDACS cell-attachment protocol based on a PKI, certificates, certificate revocation and cipher-suites including pre-and post-quantum options. Evaluations in the symbolic model show the procedure to fulfill LDACS security requirements and a communications performance evaluation demonstrates feasibility, matching requirements imposed by regulatory documents.

It will play a vital role in information security after the availability of expected powerful quantum computers. Still many quantum primitives like quantum money, blind quantum computation, quantum copy protection, etc. are theoretical as they require a completely functional quantum computer for their implementation. But one prominent quantum cryptographic primitive, the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is possible with current technology. The QKD is a key establishment system having several stages namely raw key generation, key sifting, key reconciliation, and privacy amplification. In this paper, an efficient key sifting scheme has been developed. Successful simulation has shown that the proposed modified key sifting scheme requires less time to build the sifted key compared to the sifted key in conventional BB84 protocol in most cases.

In parallel, the first quantum computing devices have become available, paving the way for a new paradigm in information processing. Data representation is important for machine learning models. High-dimensional data can be converted to low dimensional codes efficiently by an artificial neural network. Due to quantum properties, a quantum algorithm can also perform this task, leaving only the neural network to perform the classification. In this paper, a quantum angle encoding algorithm is used to encode the vibration data into a binary representation, leaving the artificial neural networks for the classification. The vibration data in converted by applying a rotation on each of the Bloch sphere axes (X, Y and Z).

The development of quantum computers (QCs) and their potential to utilize Shor’s Law, is increasingly recognized as a threat to asymmetric cryptography. In response, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is gaining prominence as a notable field of research aiming to standardize quantum resistant algorithms before the operational usage of QCs. This paper is addressed to people with preliminary knowledge in the field of cryptography and QC. Based on a literature review, the authors provide an overview of challenges faced by the research community and elaborate the advancements in addressing post-quantum threats. A migration strategy from classical cryptosystems to PQC systems is in development, but obstacles such as time constraints and improper implementation complicate the process. Full implementation could take a decade or more. Until then, our paper aims to create awareness for potential challenges when transitioning towards PQC. As categorization scheme for these potential obstacles, we refer to a well-established model in cybersecurity – the McCumber Cube. Conclusions embrace preparing for risks of improper implementation and deriving a multi-step migration. Special attention is expected to be needed for data migration of existing data sets. As a request for future research in PQC, the authors identified the process of implementing post-cryptography standards, e.g., from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and an assessment of the perceived readiness of industry to adapt. © 2022, EasyChair.

Efficient usage of resources and reliable operations are key objectives for network management. Optimization plays a pivotal role to make the best decisions in limited time. To tackle such difficult and elaborate (typically NP-hard) computational problems the latest developments in Quantum Computing are coming into focus. Successes with models for road traffic, logistics or financial industry have already demonstrated the applicability of these new methods to real-world problems. In this paper we formulate a model for resource assignment for transporting data over networks. For applicability in existing network management environments the model was designed on top of Segment Routing (SR) concepts. The validity of the model is proven for different cost and reliability targets. Based on a Digital Annealer (DA) as quantum-inspired hardware and an appropriate decomposition approach realistic data sets of a tier-1 provider can be processed. The quality of the results is comparable to classical optimization methods while the new approaches outperform those in computation time and have potential for a higher number of demands.

Quantum Cryptography provides unconditional security to the data which were transmitted. Quantum Cryptography uses two channels for communication - a classical channel and a quantum channel. However, authentication in the classical channel is currently done by the classical cryptographic algorithms that are not efficient and quantum-safe. In addition to that, the existing QKD schemes do not ensure confidentiality to the data transmitted through the classical channel. PostQuantum Cryptography(PQC) is a computational-security based cryptographic technique that is quantum-resistant.

(2022),2022,Low-loss all-optical ns-switching for single-photon routing in scalable integrated quantum photonics,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Efficient single-photon routing and switching are crucial for optical quantum computing and communication. For this purpose, all-optical switches are designed for gigahertz bandwidths. The switching mechanism is based on the optical Kerr effect via cross-phase modulation (CPM) of the single-photon signal by a strong 1550-nm pump pulse. For energy-efficient switching, this nonlinear effect is exploited in a microresonator that can either be used directly as an intensity switch in a typical add–drop configuration or as a phase shifter in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) structure. To speed up resonance build-up and quenching, a pre-emphasis build and an off-resonance wipe pulse are used. The proposed designs are verified by traveling-wave simulations which demonstrate that 0.1 dB insertion loss and ~1 ns switching windows can be achieved. For a scalable out-of-the-lab transfer, we investigate the feasibility of the proposed switch designs for fabrication in a mature photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platform. In particular, silicon nitride PICs have demonstrated record-low losses which makes them suitable for single-photon applications. By parametric modelling of the microresonator’s directional couplers based on Lumerical EME and 2.5-dimensional varFDTD simulations, the required power transmission coefficients for both signal and pump wavelength can be achieved. This results in an all-optical switch design ready for fabrication in a commercial PIC foundry which can potentially enable scalable architectures for quantum photonic applications. © 2022 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2621540,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133126285&doi=10.1117%2f12.2621540&partnerID=40&md5=b6ca09b5f2a15b20bbabb30f762b2ff4,Conference Paper

Although significant progress has been made, many technical issues remain that limit the performance of fabricated devices. One approach to accelerate progress in the engineering design of these devices is to develop improved numerical modeling methods. Current modeling methods generally rely on approximate lumped element circuit models to describe the complex network of microwave transmission lines required to operate a circuit quantum electrodynamics device. This reduction in complexity in the theoretical model is valuable for gaining insight into the operation of a device, but does limit the opportunity for using these models to optimize the performance of practical devices. To develop rigorous numerical modeling methods, it is necessary to move toward theoretical descriptions of circuit quantum electrodynamics devices that retain the full details of the three-dimensional vector electromagnetic fields that exist in these systems. In this work, we present details on such a theoretical model for one of the most commonly used circuit quantum electrodynamics systems, a transmon qubit coupled to microwave transmission lines.

(2022),2022,Improved Harris Hawks Optimization algorithm based on quantum correction and Nelder-Mead simplex method,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,"Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is a kind of intelligent algorithm that simulates the predation behavior of hawks. It suffers several shortcomings, such as low calculation accuracy, easy to fall into local optima and difficult to balance exploration and exploitation. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes an improved HHO algorithm named as QC-HHO. Firstly, the initial population is generated by Hénon Chaotic Map to enhance the randomness and ergodicity. Secondly, the quantum correction mechanism is introduced in the local search phase to improve optimization accuracy and population diversity. Thirdly, the Nelder-Mead simplex method is used to improve the search performance and breadth. Fourthly, group communication factors describing the relationship between individuals is taken into consideration. Finally, the energy consumption law is integrated into the renewal process of escape energy factor E and jump distance J to balance exploration and exploitation. The QC-HHO is tested on 10 classical benchmark functions and 30 CEC2014 benchmark functions. The results show that it is superior to original HHO algorithm and other improved HHO algorithms. At the same time, the improved algorithm studied in this paper is applied to gas leakage source localization by wireless sensor networks. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of position and gas release rate are excellent, which verifies the feasibility for application of QC-HHO in practice. ©2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.",,10.3934/mbe.2022358,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131768984&doi=10.3934%2fmbe.2022358&partnerID=40&md5=82fb82263369fdacb39adaa89147dce6,Article

When adopting a QEC scheme based on surface codes, error decoding is the most computationally expensive task in the classical electronic back-end. Decoders employing neural networks (NN) are well-suited for this task but their hardware implementation has not been presented yet. This work presents a space exploration of fully connected feed-forward NN decoders for small distance surface codes. The goal is to optimize the NN for the high-decoding performance, while keeping a minimalistic hardware implementation. This is needed to meet the tight delay constraints of real-time surface code decoding. We demonstrate that hardware-based NN-decoders can achieve the high-decoding performance comparable to other state-of-the-art decoding algorithms whilst being well below the tight delay requirements (\approx 440\ ns) of current solid-state qubit technologies for both application-specific integrated circuit designs (< \!30\ ns) and field-programmable gate array implementations (<\! 90\ ns).

It is essential in the software development process and needs a huge quantity of resources such as labor, money, and time. Automated software testing can be used to save manual work, shorten testing times, and improve testing performance. Recently, Software Bug Prediction (SBP) models have been developed to improve the software quality assurance (SQA) process through the prediction of bug parts. Advanced deep learning (DL) models can be used to classify faults in software parts. Because hyperparameters have a significant impact on the performance of any DL model, a proper hyperparameter optimization approach utilizing metaheuristic methods is required. This paper provides a unique Metaheuristic Optimization with Deep Learning based SBP (MODL-SBP) methodology to ensure software dependability and trustworthiness. The suggested technique entails creating a hybrid Convolution Neural Network (CNN) bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to forecast software pro-blems. Furthermore, the Chaotic Quantum Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CQGOA) is used for hyperparameter optimization of the CNN-BiLSTM models, which enhances predictive accuracy. To demonstrate the superior performance of the MODL-SBP technique, a wide range of simulations are performed on benchmark datasets, with the results highlighting the superior performance of the proposed model over other recent techniques. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

Typically, the photonic devices used in these environments are optimized for operation at or above room temperature, however there is an existing and growing need for optimized photonic devices to operate in cryogenic and/or high-radiation environments. Applications of these optical interconnects range from control and readout from superconducting integrated circuits for quantum computing, to readout of tracking detectors in high-energy physics (HEP) particle accelerators, to readout of next-generation infrared (IR) focal plane array (FPA) detectors. Key to the success of these optical interconnects is the high-performance and ruggedization of the electro-optic modulator (EOM), typically implemented either as a remoted external device or as a directly modulated light source. The underlying semiconductor physics models of the EOM must account for the conditions presented by the harsh environment, leading to optimization challenges at both device and link levels.

Several materials are used as a basis for these co-packaged platforms, but glass stands out for its many positive properties, such as high thermal and dimensional stability, great optical transparency, excellent high-frequency properties for electric circuits, and extremely low cost. To seize these advantages, we pursued an approach called electro-optical circuit board (EOCB), in which optical and electrical interconnections are realized by glass-integrated optical waveguides and electrical circuits on both sides of the glass board. An ion-exchange technique was developed to integrate low-loss optical single-mode waveguides into large-sized glass boards (457 mm x 303 mm). In the reported work, the next milestone in developing this process was achieved by reducing the diffusion metal mask opening's width from 6 μm to 3 μm by mask-less laser patterning. These smaller mask opening allow for optical waveguides with a more circular modal field shape resulting in smaller coupling losses to optical fibers. Additionally, the reduction of propagation losses of multi-mode waveguides for wavelengths down to the visible range was achieved. This opens up the field of sensing and quantum application to EOCBs. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Even today, the performance of calculations based on the volume density of components would greatly benefit from the 3D capability of fs-laser inscription. Although several advanced 3D devices such as photonic quantum circuits and lab-on-a-chip were successfully fabricated, compactness is still limited by the minimum achievable waveguide bend radius. Another growing interest is the laser inscription in materials with transmission up to the mid- and long-wave infrared for applications such as micro-organism detection, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostic and optical communication in the second atmospheric window at 8-12 microns. In this spectral band, materials that can be drawn into fiber optics, such as fluoride and chalcogenide glasses, are expensive and fragile. On the other hand, laser inscription allows the fabrication of waveguides in virtually any material, even crystals, enabling new IR applications, especially for harsh environmental conditions. In this communication, we present our recent progress on these two topics. First, we demonstrate waveguide bend radii down to <400 m, which is an important improvement over the minimum 10-mm radius reported previously. The high refractive index change allowing such tight bends is attributed to a femtosecond laser induced band gap shift (FLIBGS) in the material. We also report low loss depressed-cladding waveguide (DCW) in crystals for IR applications. We particularly demonstrate the challenging inscription of a large DCW for single-mode operation at 10.6 m with propagation loss of <0.63 dB/cm.

However, the master problem in Benders' decomposition is still NP-hard, which motivates us to employ quantum computing. In the paper, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition algorithm. We transfer the Benders' decomposition's master problem into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and solve it by the state-of-the-art quantum annealer.

Unfortunately, slicing inherits many of the security challenges of cloud and edge computing such as side-channel information leakage, while also encountering new challenges posed by multi-domain authorization and quantum computing. Many extant mechanisms, such as PKI, are insufficient in the face of quantum computers, and existing side-channel mitigations impose heavy overhead costs while only providing defense against known attacks. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to protecting slice control information through the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). HE allows quantum-resilient validation and distribution of critical information, while also enabling hierarchical control across multiple domains and providing encrypted computation. Further, threshold HE enables secure decryption and computation of control or measurement information, while protecting the entire slice against potential key-leakage by rendering any one key useless without the required quorum. The benchmark results shown demonstrate that the HE mechanisms used can be deployed in a practical manner, providing stalwart security guarantees against a variety of threats. © 2022 IEEE.",,10.1109/WCNC51071.2022.9771895,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130694982&doi=10.1109%2fWCNC51071.2022.9771895&partnerID=40&md5=63c732ed56c2ba9d3aadbc72cbc2a141,Conference Paper

(2022),2022,High-definition video broadcasting with a room-temperature quantum cascade laser emitting in the long-wave infrared domain,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are relevant optical sources for free-space communication because they can emit in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) domain, i.e. in the 8-12 µm region. The advantage of this optical domain is that it combines a high atmosphere transmission1 with a reduced distortion for propagating beams,2 thus the superiority of LWIR lasers in comparison with existing near-infrared systems is very dependent on link availability.3 Furthermore, QCLs are characterized by the absence of relaxation oscillation resonance.4 This peculiarity could imply a very large modulation bandwidth, even if QCL structures still need to be optimized to avoid parasitic effects.5 Recent experimental efforts have highlighted the potential of QCL-based free-space communication systems6–8 and the current 4 Gbits/s record rate is expected to be outperformed in the near future with bandwidth-enhanced structures.9 This work describes a free-space live video broadcasting with a room-temperature QCL emitting at 8.1 µm. The video file is encoded in uncompressed high-definition format (1280 pixels x 720 pixels) and this corresponds to a data rate of 1.485 Gbits/s with on-off keying scheme. This high-speed electrical signal is directly injected in the QCL via the AC port of a bias tee. The modulated optical signal from the QCL is retrieved with a Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride detector and the resulting electrical signal is sent to a TV monitor where the video can be watched in live. The current findings demonstrate the versatility of a communication system with QCLs and this paves the way for real-field applications. © 2022 SPIE · 0277-786X",,10.1117/12.2608511,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130431664&doi=10.1117%2f12.2608511&partnerID=40&md5=2d73d0b191ad2080b6fc2cd886cd5f2c,Conference Paper

Our aim is to find the structural differences caused by the substitution with the fluorine atom, the introduction of a substituent at position 3, and its modification at a peripheral site. For this purpose, we have employed state-of-art tools using knowledge-based and quantum crystallography algorithms. Our study revealed that the presence of the fluorine atom reduces both the molecular dipole moment and the hydrogen bond acceptor abilities of a ring oxygen atom, hence affecting the structure of the main hydrogen-bonded motif. The analysis shows that in the new thiomorpholine derivative, the observed motif is not optimal, and thus other polymorphs might be sought. Hierarchical analysis of weak intermolecular interactions and elucidation of large supramolecular synthons allowed us to find similarities in the networks formed by 3-substituted derivatives and their different arrangement compared to unsubstituted benzoxaboroles. This approach gives an insight into weak interaction cooperativity and their exchange upon different substitutions.

In this work, we present a systematic computational study of the thermochemical feasibility of a series of mechanistic pathways that can lead to the formation of the observed boron clusters. This allowed us to identify predominant pathways for buildup, following a complex network of pathways. We find that the preferred mechanisms are different for smaller and larger clusters. The primary mechanism for buildup in clusters up to 5 boron atoms is by addition of BH4-/BH3 species, followed by loss of H2 or H-. For larger clusters, fusion reactions dominate, again followed by the loss of H2 or H-. A few species were identified as possible branching points, where the trends for favorability change; B2H7- as an initiation step and B4H7-, B3H8-, and B9H132- as minima on the potential energy surface are most notable. This work demonstrates that borohydride clusters feature a wealth of pathways for realizing the desired products (B10H102- or B12H122-), the redundancy of which may help avoid energetic sinks or kinetic bottlenecks.

(2022),2022,"Wind Power Forecasting Models: Classification based on Type of Model, Time Horizon and Inputs, Error Metrics and Applications","Proceedings of the International Conference on Electronics and Renewable Systems, ICEARS 2022","Across the globe, renewable generation integration has been increasing in the last decades to meet ever-increasing power demand and emission targets. Wind power has dominated among various renewable sources due to the widespread availability and advanced low-cost technologies. However, the stochastic nature of wind power results in power system reliability and security issues. This is because the uncertain variability of wind power results in challenges to various system operations such as unit commitment and economic dispatch. Such problems can be addressed by accurate wind power forecasts to great extent. This attracted wider investigations for obtaining accurate power forecasts using various forecasting models such as time series, machine learning, probabilistic, and hybrid. These models use different types of inputs and obtain forecasts in different time horizons, and have different applications. Also, different investigations represent forecasting performance using different performance metrics. Limited classification reviews are available for these areas and detailed classification on these areas will help researchers and system operators to develop new accurate forecasting models. Therefore, this paper proposes a detailed review of those areas. It concludes that even though quantum investigations are available, wind power forecasting accuracy improvement is an ever-existing research problem. Also, forecasting performance indication in financial term such as deviation charges can be used to represent the economic impact of forecasting accuracy improvement. © 2022 IEEE.",,10.1109/ICEARS53579.2022.9751882,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128966998&doi=10.1109%2fICEARS53579.2022.9751882&partnerID=40&md5=c01adc24a2dbcb24554e8eb82e00840e,Conference Paper

This implies that the satellite will be necessary for the transmission of quantum keys in order to avoid these terrestrial limitations. Therefore, the current debate does not lie in the need for the satellite but rather in what type of infrastructure will be best suited, and specifically the usage of GEO vs LEO satellites. This analysis is not trivial and should not consider only the link budgets and the physical layer as it has been done up to date. It should also consider even more important factors, as the service KPIs that the end user will request such as key rate, availability, security of the keys and their maintenance, etc., as well as the possible communications architectures to provide the service. Therefore, the analysis should introduce the market oriented component, and provide the optimal solutions based on the scenarios and requirements requested by the customer.

The success of quantum communication hinges on the notion of oscillations and synchronization in the quantum regime. In this chapter, we discuss self-sustained oscillations and their synchronizations in the quantum regime. Unlike classical oscillations, quantum oscillations are bounded by several constraints of quantum mechanics. For example, although a prominent phase trajectory is possible in classical systems, quantum phase trajectories are broad due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Here we systematically introduce the concept of quantum limit cycle using the open quantum formulation. Solutions of the quantum master equation and visualizations through the Wigner function are used to demonstrate the quantum limit cycle.

(2022),2022,QuantumNAS: Noise-Adaptive Search for Robust Quantum Circuits,Proceedings - International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture,"Quantum noise is the key challenge in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Previous work for mitigating noise has primarily focused on gate-level or pulse-level noise-adaptive compilation. However, limited research has explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum circuits themselves resilient to noise.In this paper, we propose QuantumNAS, a comprehensive framework for noise-adaptive co-search of the variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural networks for machine learning and variational ansatzes for quantum simulation. However, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to decouple the circuit search from parameter training by introducing a novel SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of pre-defined parameterized gates (e.g., U3 and CU3) and trained by iteratively sampling and updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates in a fine-grained manner.Extensively evaluated with 12 quantum machine learning (QML) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) benchmarks on 14 quantum computers, QuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware search, human, random, and existing noise-adaptive qubit mapping baselines. For QML tasks, QuantumNAS is the first to demonstrate over 95% 2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class classification accuracy on real quantum computers.

(2022),2022,2022 Roadmap on integrated quantum photonics,JPhys Photonics,"Integrated photonics will play a key role in quantum systems as they grow from few-qubit prototypes to tens of thousands of qubits. The underlying optical quantum technologies can only be realized through the integration of these components onto quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) with accompanying electronics. In the last decade, remarkable advances in quantum photonic integration have enabled table-top experiments to be scaled down to prototype chips with improvements in efficiency, robustness, and key performance metrics. These advances have enabled integrated quantum photonic technologies combining up to 650 optical and electrical components onto a single chip that are capable of programmable quantum information processing, chip-to-chip networking, hybrid quantum system integration, and high-speed communications. In this roadmap article, we highlight the status, current and future challenges, and emerging technologies in several key research areas in integrated quantum photonics, including photonic platforms, quantum and classical light sources, quantum frequency conversion, integrated detectors, and applications in computing, communications, and sensing. With advances in materials, photonic design architectures, fabrication and integration processes, packaging, and testing and benchmarking, in the next decade we can expect a transition from single- and few-function prototypes to large-scale integration of multi-functional and reconfigurable devices that will have a transformative impact on quantum information science and engineering. © 2022 The Author(s).

Among various QIP features, the entanglement is a unique one. To take full advantage of quantum resources, it will be necessary to interface quantum systems based on different encodings of information both discrete and continuous. The goal of this paper is to lay the groundwork for the development of a robust and efficient hybrid continuous variable-discrete variable (CV-DV) quantum network, enabling the distribution of a large number of entangled states over hybrid DV-CV multi-hop nodes in an arbitrary topology. The proposed hybrid quantum communication network (QCN) can serve as the backbone for a future quantum Internet, thus providing extensive long-term impacts on the economy and national security through QIP, distributed quantum computing, quantum networking, and distributed quantum sensing. By employing the photon addition and photon subtraction modules we describe how to generate the hybrid DV-CV entangled states and how to implement their teleportation and entanglement swapping through entangling measurements. We then describe how to extend the transmission distance between nodes in hybrid QCN by employing macroscopic light states, noiseless amplification, and reconfigurable quantum LDPC coding. We further describe how to enable quantum networking and distributed quantum computing by employing the deterministic cluster state concept introduced here. Finally, we describe how the proposed hybrid CV-DV states can be used in an entanglement-based hybrid QKD. © 2013 IEEE.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3154468,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125727059&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3154468&partnerID=40&md5=246ad11dcf86d1be0a997196f94a46d4,Article

(2022),2022,An Optimal Deep Learning for Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System,"Computers, Materials and Continua","Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) plays a vital role in the future road traffic management system. A vital element of C-ITS comprises vehicles, road side units, and traffic command centers, which produce a massive quantity of data comprising both mobility and service-related data. For the extraction of meaningful and related details out of the generated data, data science acts as an essential part of the upcoming C-ITS applications. At the same time, prediction of short-term traffic flow is highly essential to manage the traffic accurately. Due to the rapid increase in the amount of traffic data, deep learning (DL) models are widely employed, which uses a non-parametric approach for dealing with traffic flow forecasting. This paper focuses on the design of intelligent deep learning based short-term traffic flow prediction (IDL-STFLP) model for C-ITS that assists the people in various ways, namely optimization of signal timing by traffic signal controllers, travelers being able to adapt and alter their routes, and so on. The presented IDL-STFLP model operates on two main stages namely vehicle counting and traffic flow prediction. The IDL-STFLP model employs the Fully Convolutional Redundant Counting (FCRC) based vehicle count process. In addition, deep belief network (DBN) model is applied for the prediction of short-term traffic flow. To further improve the performance of the DBN in traffic flow prediction, it will be optimized by Quantum-behaved bat algorithm (QBA) which optimizes the tunable parameters of DBN. Experimental results based on benchmark dataset show that the presented method can count vehicles and predict traffic flow in real-time with a maximum performance under dissimilar environmental situations. ©2022 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)",,10.32604/cmc.2022.020244,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125716670&doi=10.32604%2fcmc.2022.020244&partnerID=40&md5=91cfdb5dac196e05ee392cae2bd97050,Article

In contactless human-computer systems, shared intentionality should play a key role in the deep learning of artificial neural networks that would provide adequate replacement of missing body parts. This concept design introduces a possible trend of further research on shared intentionality. The paper’s central idea is that any biological system tends to goal-directed coherence–shared intentionality is an essential quality of humans. The article presents a hypothesis of the neurobiological foundations of shared intentionality. The paper reviews studies of different biological systems and suggests the main qualities of goal-directed coherence that are common to all: instantaneousness in time, independence from a distance, insensitivity to sensory perception. The article also notes recent findings in physics. The integrated analysis poses the research question: can a single harmonic oscillator induce quantum entanglement between neurons and a computer interface. The author believes that an answer to the problem gives us an understanding of whether the human brain can directly govern the computer without introducing artificial elements into the nervous system. A valuable outcome of this ongoing research project about possible contactless brain-computer interaction may be direct or indirect evidence of (i) contactless brain-computer interaction; (ii) the synergy of this interaction.

In particular, a family of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, consisting of classical and quantum elements, has been massively explored for the purpose of improving the performance of classical neural networks.

Our method extends the concept of dilated convolution, which has been widely applied in modern deep learning algorithms, to the context of hybrid neural networks. The proposed QDCNNs are able to capture larger context during the quantum convolution process while reducing the computational cost.

Although several experimental demonstrations of QKD have been reported, they have not considered the polarization-dependent loss in state preparation in the key-rate estimation. In this study, we experimentally characterized polarization-dependent loss in realistic state-preparation devices and verified that a considerable polarization-dependent loss exists in fiber- and silicon-based polarization modulators. Hence, the security of such QKD systems is compromised because of the secure key rate overestimation. Furthermore, we report a decoy-state BB84 QKD experiment considering polarization-dependent loss.

The main issue to be addressed in CGI technology is how to achieve rapid and high-quality imaging while assuring the secure transmission of detection data in practical distant imaging applications. In order to address the mentioned issues, this paper proposes a remote secure CGI method based on quantum communication technology. Using the quantum key distribution (QKD) network, the CGI system can be reconstructed while solving the problem of information security transmission between the detector and the reconstructed computing device. By exploring the influence of different random measurement matrices on the quality of image reconstruction, it is found that the randomness of the numerical sequence constituting the matrix is positively correlated with the imaging quality. Based on this discovery, a new type of quantum cryptography measurement matrix is constructed using quantum cryptography with good randomness. In addition, through further orthogonalization and normalization of the matrix, the matrix has both good randomness and orthogonality, and high-quality imaging results can be obtained at a low sampling rate. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by simulation imaging experiments. Compared with the traditional GI system, the method proposed in this paper has higher transmission security and high-quality imaging under this premise, which provides a new idea for the practical development of CGI technology. © 2013 IEEE.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3144297,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123368313&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3144297&partnerID=40&md5=0490e883b16f828b6dc9246e6ced78b8,Article

In expert systems, for protecting sensitive information, various encryption techniques such as classical encryption and quantum encryption are used. In these systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to analyze the data at runtime and to detect unauthorized users in the early stage especially for tracking online harms. These systems are not completely secured, because the encryption techniques have some loopholes such as the algorithm’s short life expectancy and less computation power. An unauthorized user destroys the precious data, as well as the system, might access these loopholes. As the confidentiality and integrity of expert systems are threatened by intrusions and real-time attacks related to privacy and cyber-security, there is a need for proposing novel methodologies to predict future attacks and identify new threat patterns. To analyze the behavior of the intruder and overcome the encryption weaknesses, this paper presents an Artificial General Intelligence-based Rational Behavior Detection Agent (AGI-RBDA). The proposed system possesses human-like rationality for protecting the information like a human mind. It is exposed that the human mind does not apply any kind of encryption technique; instead, it used various cognitive correlates such as intention, perception, motivation, emotions, and implicit and explicit knowledge for the secrecy of sensitive information.

However, the application of quantum computers in clouds would be realized from the recent breakthrough results of quantum computers. Existing authentication schemes based on conventional hardness assumptions will be confronted with quantum attackers in the near future. A lattice-based authentication scheme resolves this tension. Although, existing lattice-based authentication schemes employing identity-based signcryption (IBS), the security against misbehaved private key generators (mPKG) is not well-considered, which may cause privacy issues in some application scenarios since the mPKG can generate the secret key for any given identity. This paper proposes an IBS-based authentication scheme for cloud storage dubbed LAMA that thwarts adversaries who have quantum computing power. We integrate the IBS scheme with the lattice-based cryptography, which is the variant of existing IBS-based authentication schemes and is post-quantum secure. We integrate identity certifying authority (ICA) with private key generator (PKG) to ensure security against mPKG. Our comprehensive security proof demonstrates that LAMA is indistinguishable against chosen plaintext attacks and secure against mPKG. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of LAMA, which demonstrates the high efficiency of LAMA in terms of computation and communication overhead and proves that it can be easily deployed on low configured user devices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s12652-021-03620-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122824918&doi=10.1007%2fs12652-021-03620-z&partnerID=40&md5=0f181f20a012acedf9d281802fa38432,Article

Compared with classical networks, small-world quantum networks have some interesting properties. The topology of the network can be changed through entanglement exchange operations, and different network topologies will result in different percolation thresholds when performing entanglement percolation. A lower percolation threshold means that quantum networks require fewer minimum resources for communication. Since a shared singlet between two nodes can still be a limitation, concurrency percolation theory (ConPT) can be used to relax the condition. In this paper, we investigate how entanglement distribution is performed in small-world quantum networks to ensure that nodes in the network can communicate with each other by establishing communication links through entanglement swapping. Any node can perform entanglement swapping on only part of the connected edges, which can reduce the influence of each node in the network during entanglement swapping. In addition, the ConPT method is used to reduce the percolation threshold even further, thus obtaining a better network structure and reducing the resources required. © 2022 by the authors.

On this basis, random forest is used to predict the high-precision optimal parameters, thereby eliminating the simulation and iteration required by the search method to meet the real-time optimization of the future QKD network. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,10.1088/2058-9565/ac37b2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122541203&doi=10.1088%2f2058-9565%2fac37b2&partnerID=40&md5=5f952e85f4a3ba19afbbb3993932b5ae,Article

For this purpose, we analyse the correlation between certainty factors and quantum probability. We first explore the certainty factors approach for inexact reasoning from a classical point of view. Next, we introduce some basic aspects of quantum computing, and we pay special attention to quantum rule-based systems. In this context, a specific use case was built: an inferential network for testing the behaviour of the certainty factors approach in a quantum environment. After the design and execution of the experiments, the corresponding analysis of the obtained results was performed in three different scenarios: (1) inaccuracy in declarative knowledge, or imprecision, (2) inaccuracy in procedural knowledge, or uncertainty, and (3) inaccuracy in both declarative and procedural knowledge.

These cryptosystems are currently used for the exchange of keys between servers and clients over the Internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next step in the evolution of the Internet, and it involves the connection of millions of low-powered and resource-constrained devices to the network. Because quantum computers are becoming more capable, the creation of a new cryptographic standard that cannot be compromised by them is indispensable. There are several current proposals of quantum-resistant or post-quantum algorithms that are being considered for future standards. Given that the IoT is increasing in popularity, and given its resource-constrained nature, it is worth adapting those new standards to IoT devices. In this work, we study some post-quantum cryptosystems that could be suitable for IoT devices, adapting them to work with current cryptography and communication software, and conduct a performance measurement on them, obtaining guidelines for selecting the best for different applications in resource-constrained hardware. Our results show that many of these algorithms can be efficiently executed in current IoT hardware, providing adequate protection from the attacks that quantum computers will eventually be capable of. © 2022 by the authors.

(2022),2022,Post-quantum lightweight identity-based two-party authenticated key exchange protocol for Internet of Vehicles with probable security,Computer Communications,"With Internet of Things (IoT) growing rapidly, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become an essential part of smart cities and has attracted the full attention of both academic and business communities. Because of the public transmission channel, the security and privacy in IoV have paid serious attention. In IoV, it is crucial to generate a secret session key among the various vehicles and road-side units (RSUs) so that they can share the confidential information over the public Internet. Thus, an authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocol should be needed that can achieve the session key requirement in the IoV for secure communication. For this purpose, various AKA techniques has been designed using a number of different tools. Several existing AKA protocols either suffer from different attacks or inefficient for IoV environment due to its excessive communication and computational costs. Many such traditional schemes have used either Diffie–Hellman (DH) or prime factorization type hard problems. These hard problems are vulnerable to the futuristic technologies like quantum computer. Besides, existing quantum resistance AKA protocols use lattice cryptography for its security. However, these protocols either incurs an overhead of certificate management or have excessive communication and computational costs. Hence, there is a need of quantum resistance AKA protocols which removes the certificate overhead and also efficient for the IoV. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based two-party authenticated key agreement (LB-ID-2PAKA) protocol using identity-based cryptography (IBC). The lattice hard problems could resist the quantum computers and IBC could remove the overhead of certificate management. The security strength of proposed LB-ID-2PAKA protocol is analyzed under the random oracle model to show its robustness against the present as well as future quantum attacks. In addition, the resiliency against different security attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, known-key security (K-KS), unknown key-share (UK-S) attack etc. are also included. Further, the performance analysis shows that the proposed LB-ID-2PAKA protocol outperforms the existing protocols and feasible for IoV applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.comcom.2021.09.031,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117073263&doi=10.1016%2fj.comcom.2021.09.031&partnerID=40&md5=982c885873ca7a11091f5aab6f3c871c,Article

Many traffic-related problems in future smart cities can be sorted out with the incorporation of IoV in transportation. IoV communication enables the collection and distribution of real-time essential data regarding road network condition. In this scenario, energy-efficient and reliable intercommunication routes are essential among vehicular nodes in sustainable urban computing. With this motivation, the current research article presents a new Artificial Intelligence-based Energy Efficient Clustering with Routing (AI-EECR) Protocol for IoV in urban computing. The proposed AI-EECR protocol operates under three stages namely, network initialization, Cluster Head (CH) selection, and routing protocol. The presented AI-EECR protocol determines the CHs from vehicles with the help of Quantum Chemical Reaction Optimization (QCRO) algorithm. QCRO algorithm derives a fitness function with the help of vehicle speed, trust level, and energy level of the vehicle. In order to make appropriate routing decisions, a set of relay nodes was selected using Group Teaching Optimization Algorithm (GTOA). The performance of the presented AI-EECR model, in terms of energy efficiency, was validated against different aspects and a brief comparative analysis was conducted.

(2022),2022,"Quantum computing: A taxonomy, systematic review and future directions",Software - Practice and Experience,"Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging paradigm with the potential to offer significant computational advantage over conventional classical computing by exploiting quantum-mechanical principles such as entanglement and superposition. It is anticipated that this computational advantage of QC will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable problems in several application domains such as drug design, data science, clean energy, finance, industrial chemical development, secure communications, and quantum chemistry. In recent years, tremendous progress in both quantum hardware development and quantum software/algorithm has brought QC much closer to reality. Indeed, the demonstration of quantum supremacy marks a significant milestone in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era—the next logical step being the quantum advantage whereby quantum computers solve a real-world problem much more efficiently than classical computing. As the quantum devices are expected to steadily scale up in the next few years, quantum decoherence and qubit interconnectivity are two of the major challenges to achieve quantum advantage in the NISQ era. QC is a highly topical and fast-moving field of research with significant ongoing progress in all facets. A systematic review of the existing literature on QC will be invaluable to understand the state-of-the-art of this emerging field and identify open challenges for the QC community to address in the coming years. This article presents a comprehensive review of QC literature and proposes taxonomy of QC. The proposed taxonomy is used to map various related studies to identify the research gaps.

336,Scopus,Otgonbaatar & Datcu (2022),2022,Natural Embedding of the Stokes Parameters of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Images in a Gate-Based Quantum Computer,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"Quantum algorithms are designed to process quantum data (quantum bits) in a gate-based quantum computer. They are proven rigorously that they reveal quantum advantages over conventional algorithms when their inputs are certain quantum data or some classical data mapped to quantum data. However, in a practical domain, data are classical in nature, and they are very big in dimension, size, and so on. Hence, there is a challenge to map (embed) classical data to quantum data, and even no quantum advantages of quantum algorithms are demonstrated over conventional ones when one processes the mapped classical data in a gate-based quantum computer. For the practical domain of earth observation (EO), due to the different sensors on remote-sensing platforms, we can map directly some types of EO data to quantum data. In particular, we have polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images characterized by polarized beams. A polarized state of the polarized beam and a quantum bit are the Doppelganger of a physical state. We map them to each other, and we name this direct mapping a natural embedding, otherwise an artificial embedding. Furthermore, we process our naturally embedded data in a gate-based quantum computer by using a quantum algorithm regardless of its quantum advantages over conventional techniques; namely, we use the QML network as a quantum algorithm to prove that we naturally embedded our data in input qubits of a gate-based quantum computer. Therefore, we employed and directly processed PolSAR images in a QML network. Furthermore, we designed and provided a QML network with an additional layer of a neural network, namely, a hybrid quantum-classical network, and demonstrate how to program (via optimization and backpropagation) this hybrid quantum-classical network when employing and processing PolSAR images. In this work, we used a gate-based quantum computer offered by an IBM Quantum and a classical simulator for a gate-based quantum computer. Our contribution is that we provided very specific EO data with a natural embedding feature, the Doppelganger of quantum bits, and processed them in a hybrid quantum-classical network. More importantly, in the future, these PolSAR data can be processed by future quantum algorithms and future quantum computing platforms to obtain (or demonstrate) some quantum advantages over conventional techniques for EO problems. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/TGRS.2021.3110056,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115123805&doi=10.1109%2fTGRS.2021.3110056&partnerID=40&md5=bed83d03e15b635bbc76a40357c25085,Article

In this exploratory study, we assess a PQC for classifying a two-label EO image dataset and compare it with a classic deep learning classifier. We use the PQC with an input space of only 17 quantum bits (qubits) due to the current limitations of quantum technology. As a real-world image for EO, we selected the Eurosat dataset obtained from multispectral Sentinel-2 images as a training dataset and a Sentinel-2 image of Berlin, Germany, as a test image. However, the high dimensionality of our images is incompatible with the PQC input domain of 17 qubits. Hence, we had to reduce the dimensionality of the input images for this two-label case to a vector with 16 elements; the 17th qubit remains reserved for storing label information. We employed a very deep convolutional network with an autoencoder as a technique for the dimensionality reduction of the input image, and we mapped the dimensionally reduced image onto 16 qubits by means of parameter thresholding. Then, we used a PQC to classify the two-label content of the dimensionally reduced Eurosat image dataset. A PQC classifies the Eurosat images with high accuracy as a classic deep learning method (and with even better accuracy in some instances). From our experiment, we derived and enhanced deeper insight into programming future gate-based quantum computers for many practical problems in EO. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/LGRS.2021.3108014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114722754&doi=10.1109%2fLGRS.2021.3108014&partnerID=40&md5=ec297aa04f5e3ad493b1f1f03a81b228,Article

The calculations show that four-phonon scattering significantly affects the lattice thermal conductivity (κ) of BPN.

Moreover, our results demonstrate that the thermal transport in BPN could also be greatly suppressed by hydrogenation, where the κ of HBPN along the x (y) direction is merely 16.62% (10.14%) of that of pristine BPN at 300 K. The mechanism causing such an obvious decrease of κ of HBPN is identified to be due to the enhanced phonon scattering rate and reduced group velocity, which is further revealed by the increased scattering phase space and weakened C-C bond.

(2021),2021,On the Quantum Performance Evaluation of Two Distributed Quantum Architectures,Performance Evaluation Review,"Distributed quantum applications impose requirements on the quality of the quantum states that they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations of quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in understanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum hardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and traditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world implementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades the quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two possible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum network. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in which the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The second corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions over two distinct devices. We model these architectures as continuous-time Markov chains and compare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled quantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that it takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an illustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on Nitrogen- Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for presentday device parameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications, and the other for networkheavy ones. We validate our analysis with the quantum network simulator NetSquid. Besides the detailed study of these architectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that connect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum quality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum technologies. This provides a valuable new tool for performance evaluation experts, and its applications extend beyond the two architectures studied in this work. © 2022 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,10.1145/3529113.3529123,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127587088&doi=10.1145%2f3529113.3529123&partnerID=40&md5=244a4fb3e843648c5ad2df870cc977ff,Article
345,Scopus,Walk & Eisert (2021),2021,Sharing Classical Secrets with Continuous-Variable Entanglement: Composable Security and Network Coding Advantage,PRX Quantum,"Secret sharing is a multiparty cryptographic primitive that can be applied to a network of partially distrustful parties for encrypting data that is both sensitive (it must remain secure) and important (it must not be lost or destroyed). When sharing classical secrets (as opposed to quantum states), one can distinguish between protocols that leverage bipartite quantum key distribution (QKD) and those that exploit multipartite entanglement. The latter class are known to be vulnerable to so-called participant attacks and, while progress has been made recently, there is currently no analysis that quantifies their performance in the composable, finite-size regime, which has become the gold standard for QKD security. Given this - and the fact that distributing multipartite entanglement is typically challenging - one might well ask is there any virtue in pursuing multipartite entanglement-based schemes? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a class of secret-sharing protocols based on continuous-variable graph states. We establish security in a composable framework and identify a network topology, specifically a bottleneck network of lossy channels, and parameter regimes within the reach of present-day experiments for which a multipartite scheme outperforms the corresponding QKD-based method in the asymptotic and finite-size setting. Finally, we establish experimental parameters where the multipartite schemes outperform any possible QKD-based protocol. This is one of the first concrete compelling examples of multipartite entangled resources achieving a genuine advantage over point-to-point protocols for quantum communication and represents a rigorous, operational benchmark to assess the usefulness of such resources. © 2021 authors.

The advantage is maximised by a regime that includes a very high background, which occurs naturally when one considers microwave operation. Such a regime has well-known practical limitations, though it is clear that, theoretically, knowledge of the associated classical benchmark in the microwave is lacking. The requirement of amplifiers for signal detection necessarily renders the optimal classical protocol here different to that which is traditionally used, and only applicable in the optical domain. This work outlines what is the true classical benchmark for the microwave Quantum illumination using coherent states, providing new bounds on error probability and closed formulae for the receiver operating characteristic, for both optimal (based on quantum relative entropy) and homodyne detection schemes. An alternative source generation procedure based on coherent states is also proposed, which demonstrates the potential to make classically optimal performances achievable in optical applications. The same bounds and measures for the performance of such a source are provided, and its potential utility in the future of room temperature quantum detection schemes in the microwave is discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

This technological paradigm-switch creates opportunities and challenges for industry, innovation and society. Several large companies, as well as start-ups, have started to develop and engineer quantum devices or begun to integrate them into their products: the commercial success of QT, together with progress in research and development, relies on certification and reliability built upon internationally agreed standards and metrological traceability. A group of European National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Delegated Institutes (DIs) have recently created a European Metrology Network for Quantum Technologies (EMN-Q) under the auspices of EURAMET. The objective of the EMN-Q is to co-ordinate the activities of the European NMIs and Dis to ensure their efficient support for European competitiveness in quantum technologies. A special focus of the EMN-Q will be to develop new measurement capabilities and dedicated services to serve the rapidly-growing needs of industry and research institutions in this field. Industry, governmental agencies, academic sectors or any other type of stakeholder are welcome to contact the EMN-Q and discuss their metrology needs. These can relate not only to quantum characteristics of quantum devices, but also to metrology of key enabling technologies, metrology that can improve the supply chain of industrial quantum devices or other industrial needs connected with quantum technologies. EMN-Q aims to become is to become the central contact point to stakeholders interested in metrology for quantum technologies by: • contributing to standardisation & certification of quantum technologies; • promoting the take-up of metrology in the development of these technologies; • supporting industrial needs in synergy with the technological objectives of the EC Quantum Flagship and national quantum technology programs; and • promoting the use of quantum measurement techniques where advantageous for “classical” technical areas. We are in process of structuring and developing the communication services of the EMN-Q. One of the key aspect in this EMN-Q development is the establishment the EMN-Q Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). The SRA will contain the technological roadmaps that are created by the EMN-Q members in consultation with the EMN-Q Stakeholder Community. In this paper, we will provide a short overview of the EMN-Q organization, and of the SRA and the relative Technological Roadmaps. © 2021",,10.1016/j.measen.2021.100348,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122650844&doi=10.1016%2fj.measen.2021.100348&partnerID=40&md5=c7f5d549cb32d0c8fbc853923bd5bcd3,Conference Paper

(2021),2021,A machine learning approach to Bayesian parameter estimation,npj Quantum Information,"Bayesian estimation is a powerful theoretical paradigm for the operation of the approach to parameter estimation. However, the Bayesian method for statistical inference generally suffers from demanding calibration requirements that have so far restricted its use to systems that can be explicitly modeled. In this theoretical study, we formulate parameter estimation as a classification task and use artificial neural networks to efficiently perform Bayesian estimation. We show that the network’s posterior distribution is centered at the true (unknown) value of the parameter within an uncertainty given by the inverse Fisher information, representing the ultimate sensitivity limit for the given apparatus. When only a limited number of calibration measurements are available, our machine-learning-based procedure outperforms standard calibration methods. Our machine-learning-based procedure is model independent, and is thus well suited to “black-box sensors”, which lack simple explicit fitting models. Thus, our work paves the way for Bayesian quantum sensors that can take advantage of complex nonclassical quantum states and/or adaptive protocols. These capabilities can significantly enhance the sensitivity of future devices. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41534-021-00497-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122147547&doi=10.1038%2fs41534-021-00497-w&partnerID=40&md5=1668673ff6a4e677c8c26d828b80d2d2,Article

Recent years have witnessed a significant development in cavity magnonics based on collective spin excitations in ferrimagnetic crystals, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Magnonic systems are considered to be a promising building block for a future quantum network. However, a major limitation of the system is that the coherence time of the magnon excitations is limited by their intrinsic loss (typically in the order of 1μs for YIG). Here, we show that by coupling the magnonic system to a mechanical system using optical pulses, an arbitrary magnonic state (either classical or quantum) can be transferred to and stored in a distant long-lived mechanical resonator. The fidelity depends on the pulse parameters and the transmission loss. We further show that the magnonic and mechanical nodes can be prepared in a macroscopic entangled state. These demonstrate the quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution in such a novel quantum network of magnonic and mechanical nodes. Our work shows the possibility to connect two separate fields of optomagnonics and optomechanics, and to build a long-distance quantum network based on magnonic and mechanical systems. © 2021 authors.

Towards a global-scale quantum-secured network, satellite communications seem to be a promising candidate to successfully support the quantum communication infrastructure (QCI) by delivering quantum keys to optical ground terminals. In this research, we examined the feasibility of satellite-to-ground QKD under daylight and nighttime conditions using the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol. We evaluated its performance on a hypothetical constellation with 10 satellites in sun-synchronous Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that are assumed to communicate over a period of one year with three optical ground stations (OGSs) located in Greece. By taking into account the atmospheric effects of turbulence as well as the background solar radiance, we showed that positive normalized secure key rates (SKRs) up to 3.9 × 10−4 (bps/pulse) can be obtained, which implies that satellite-to-ground QKD can be feasible for various conditions, under realistic assumptions in an existing infrastructure. © 2021 by the authors.

Here we explore their use for quantum communication, where we demonstrate a single-phonon surface acoustic wave transmission line, which links two physically separated qubit nodes. Each node comprises a microwave phonon transducer, an externally controlled superconducting variable coupler, and a superconducting qubit. Using this system, precisely shaped individual itinerant phonons are used to coherently transfer quantum information between the two physically distinct quantum nodes, enabling the high-fidelity node-to-node transfer of quantum states as well as the generation of a two-node Bell state. We further explore the dispersive interactions between an itinerant phonon emitted from one node and interacting with the superconducting qubit in the remote node.

352,Scopus,Köfinger & Hummer (2021),2021,Empirical optimization of molecular simulation force fields by Bayesian inference,European Physical Journal B,"Abstract: The demands on the accuracy of force fields for classical molecular dynamics simulations are steadily growing as larger and more complex systems are studied over longer times. One way to meet these growing demands is to hand over the learning of force fields and their parameters to machines in a systematic (semi)automatic manner. Doing so, we can take full advantage of exascale computing, the increasing availability of experimental data, and advances in quantum mechanical computations and the calculation of experimental observables from molecular ensembles. Here, we discuss and illustrate the challenges one faces in this endeavor and explore a way forward by adapting the Bayesian inference of ensembles (BioEn) method [Hummer and Köfinger, J. Chem. Phys. (2015)] for force field parameterization. In the Bayesian inference of force fields (BioFF) method developed here, the optimization problem is regularized by a simplified prior on the force field parameters and an entropic prior acting on the ensemble. The latter compensates for the unavoidable over simplifications in the parameter prior. We determine optimal force field parameters using an iterative predictor–corrector approach, in which we run simulations, determine the reference ensemble using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), and update the force field according to the BioFF posterior. We illustrate this approach for a simple polymer model, using the distance between two labeled sites as the experimental observable. By systematically resolving force field issues, instead of just reweighting a structural ensemble, the BioFF corrections extend to observables not included in ensemble reweighting. We envision future force field optimization as a formalized, systematic, and (semi)automatic machine-learning effort that incorporates a wide range of data from experiment and high-level quantum chemical calculations, and takes advantage of exascale computing resources.

Recent progress in protein development resulted in a great variety of novel LSSRFPs; however, the selection of the right LSSRFP for a given applica-tion is hampered by the lack of a side-by-side comparison of the LSSRFPs’ performance. In this study, we employed rational design and random mutagenesis to convert conventional bright RFP mScarlet into LSSRFP, called LSSmScarlet, characterized by excitation/emission maxima at 470/598 nm. In addition, we utilized the previously reported LSSRFPs mCyRFP1, CyOFP1, and mCRISPRed as templates for directed molecular evolution to develop their optimized versions, called dCyRFP2s, dCyOFP2s and CRISPRed2s. We performed a quantitative assessment of the developed LSSRFPs and their precursors in vitro on purified proteins and compared their brightness at 488 nm excitation in the mammalian cells. The monomeric LSSmScarlet protein was successfully utilized for the confocal imaging of the structural proteins in live mammalian cells and multicolor confocal imaging in conjugation with other FPs. LSSmScarlet was successfully applied for dual-color two-photon imaging in live mammalian cells. We also solved the X-ray structure of the LSSmScarlet protein at the resolution of 1.4Å that revealed a hydrogen bond network supporting excited-state proton transfer (ESPT). Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamic simulations confirmed the ESPT mechanism of a large Stokes shift.

We developed an atmospheric attenuation and satellite optical scattering model to estimate the rate of excess noise photons that can be injected into a satellite QKD channel by an off-axis laser, and calculated the effect this added noise has on the quantum bit error rate. We show that a ground-based laser on the order of 1 kW can significantly disrupt modern satellite QKD systems due to photons scattering off the satellite being detected by the QKD receiver on the ground. This class of laser can be purchased commercially, meaning such a method of disruption could be a serious threat to effectively securing high-value communications via satellite QKD in the future.

The task of multi-channel discrimination creates a scenario in which the discrimination of multiple quantum channels can be equated to the idea of pattern recognition, highly relevant to the tasks of quantum reading, illumination and more. Although the optimal quantum strategy for many scenarios is an entangled idler-assisted protocol, the extension to a multi-hypothesis setting invites the exploration of discrimination strategies based on unassisted, multipartite probe states. In this work, we expand the space of possible quantum-enhanced protocols by formulating general classes of unassisted multi-channel discrimination protocols which are not assisted by idler modes. Developing a general framework for idler-free protocols, we perform an explicit investigation in the bosonic setting, studying prominent Gaussian channel discrimination problems for real-world applications. Our findings uncover the existence of strongly quantum advantageous, idler-free protocols for the discrimination of bosonic loss and environmental noise.

Currently, most of the single-photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single-photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top-down etched, heavily doped p-type InP nanowires and n-type aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier-selective contact are used to form a radial p–n junction with a built-in electric field exceeding 3 × 105 V cm−1 at 0 V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0 V, enabled by its design to realize near-ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600 MHz with a timing jitter of 538 ps.

Nuclear spins in diamond are particularly attractive due to their long coherence time. With the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre, such nuclear qubits benefit from an auxiliary electronic qubit, which, at cryogenic temperatures, enables probabilistic entanglement mediated optically by photonic links. Here, we demonstrate a concept of a microelectronic quantum device at ambient conditions using diamond as wide bandgap semiconductor. The basic quantum processor unit – a single 14N nuclear spin coupled to the NV electron – is read photoelectrically and thus operates in a manner compatible with nanoscale electronics. The underlying theory provides the key ingredients for photoelectric quantum gate operations and readout of nuclear qubit registers. This demonstration is, therefore, a step towards diamond quantum devices with a readout area limited by inter-electrode distance rather than by the diffraction limit.

However, the production of microalgal biofuels is not yet sufficiently cost-effective for commercial applications. To screen higher lipid-producing strains, heavy carbon ion beams are applied to induce a genetic mutant. An RNA-seq technology is used to identify the pathways and genes of importance related to photosynthesis and biofuel production. The deep elucidation of photosynthesis and the fatty acid metabolism pathway involved in lipid yield is valuable information for further optimization studies. This study provided the photosynthetic efficiency and transcriptome profiling of a unicellular microalgae, Scenedesmus obliqnus mutant SO120G, with enhanced lipid production induced by heavy carbon ion beams. The lipid yield (52.5 mg L−1) of SO120G mutant were enhanced 2.4 fold compared with that of the wild strain under the nitrogen deficient condition. In addition, the biomass and growth rate were 57% and 25% higher, respectively, in SO120G than in the wild type, likely owing to an improved maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) of photosynthesis. As for the major pigment compositions, the content of chlorophyll a and carotenoids was higher in SO120G than in the wild type. The transcriptome data confirmed that a total of 2077 genes with a change of at least twofold were recognized as differential expression genes (DEGs), of which 1060 genes were up-regulated and 1017 genes were down-regulated. Most of the DEGs involved in lipid biosynthesis were up-regulated with the mutant SO120G. The expression of the gene involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis and photosynthesis of SO120G was upregulated, while that related to starch metabolism decreased compared with that of the wild strain. This work demonstrated that heavy-ion irradiation is an promising strategy for quality improvement. In addition, the mutant SO120G was shown to be a potential algal strain for enhanced lipid production. Transcriptome sequencing and annotation of the mutant suggested the possible genes responsible for lipid biosynthesis and photosynthesis, and identified the putative target genes for future genetic manipulation and biotechnological applications. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41598-021-88954-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107124554&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-88954-6&partnerID=40&md5=3b0e6fb9e4122dd1baad8a54056ae62d,Article

In recent years, much progress has been made towards realising the first DIQKD experiments, but current proposals are just out of reach of today’s loophole-free Bell experiments. Here, we significantly narrow the gap between the theory and practice of DIQKD with a simple variant of the original protocol based on the celebrated Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality. By using two randomly chosen key generating bases instead of one, we show that our protocol significantly improves over the original DIQKD protocol, enabling positive keys in the high noise regime for the first time. We also compute the finite-key security of the protocol for general attacks, showing that approximately 108–1010 measurement rounds are needed to achieve positive rates using state-of-the-art experimental parameters. Our proposed DIQKD protocol thus represents a highly promising path towards the first realisation of DIQKD in practice. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41467-021-23147-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106333815&doi=10.1038%2fs41467-021-23147-3&partnerID=40&md5=d40ce83f7e4bc581cd464ee0ebb4dad5,Article

They are, however, prone to significantly increased thermal noise caused by in-orbit radiation damage. Previous work demonstrated that a one-time application of thermal annealing reduces radiation-damage-induced APD thermal noise. Here we examine the effect of cyclical proton irradiation and thermal annealing. We use an accelerated testing environment which emulates a realistic two-year operating profile of a satellite in low-Earth-orbit. We show that repeated thermal annealing is effective at maintaining thermal noise of silicon APDs within a range suitable for quantum key distribution throughout the nominal mission life, and beyond. We examine two strategies—annealing at a fixed period of time, and annealing only when the thermal noise exceeds a pre-defined limit. We find both strategies exhibit similar thermal noise at end-of-life, with a slight overall advantage to annealing conditionally. We also observe that afterpulsing probability of the detector increases with cumulative proton irradiation.

For a QKD network of n users, this method requires Cn2=n(n−1)/2 pairs of symmetric keys to realize pairwise interconnection. In contrast, with the help of a mature public key infrastructure (PKI) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with quantum-resistant security, each user only needs to apply for one digital certificate from a certificate authority (CA) to achieve efficient and secure authentication for QKD. We need to assume only the short-term security of the PQC algorithm to achieve long-term security of the distributed keys. Here, we experimentally verified the feasibility, efficiency, and stability of the PQC algorithm in QKD authentication, and demonstrated the advantages when new users join the QKD network.

They are faster than other collision algorithms, and the attacks against PRINCE and Chaskey are the most efficient known to date. As Elephant has a key smaller than its state size, the algorithm is less efficient and its cost ends up very close to or above the cost of exhaustive search. We also propose an optimized quantum circuit for boolean linear algebra as well as complete reversible implementations of PRINCE, Chaskey, spongent and Keccak which are of independent interest for quantum cryptanalysis. We stress that our attacks could be applied in the future against today’s communications, and recommend caution when choosing symmetric constructions for cases where long-term security is expected. © 2021, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

Since they are susceptible to be attacked, solutions must be explored to make them more trustworthy and, thus, increment the confidence of their users. It is common that trusted devices use secret keys to achieve confidentiality of data stored in non-volatile memory, data in transit, and to authenticate themselves to other parties. However, these keys can be compromised if an attacker takes control of the platform by exploiting some vulnerability. In this work, we propose to seal the secret keys to the platform and to a specific state, mainly associated with the memory content and determined in a development stage. The secret keys are encrypted with a Sealing Secret Key that is not stored in the device, but obfuscated with an SRAM PUF, making it more secure. When a secret key has to be sealed or unsealed, functions called seal() and unseal() are employed. They have atomic execution and are stored in a ROM memory. Their goal is to measure the state of the platform and recuperate the sealing secret key only if the measurement matches a valid one signed by the application developer. As quantum computers are emerging and future IoT devices must be resistant to attacks performed by them, we choose Dilithium and Saturnin as cryptographic primitives. Benchmarking results taken in an ESP32 microcontroller show the suitability of the proposal for an IoT device. © 2021 ACM.",,10.1145/3487405.3487651,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120535660&doi=10.1145%2f3487405.3487651&partnerID=40&md5=c65ea78ec39a8efee374ae67edf45702,Conference Paper

These ANN propagators are trained to map nonstationary wavepackets from a given time to a future time within the discrete variable representation. Each propagator is trained for a specified time step, and iterative application of the propagator enables the propagation of wavepackets over long time scales. Such ANN propagators are developed and applied to one- and two-dimensional proton transfer systems, which exhibit nuclear quantum effects such as hydrogen tunneling. These ANN propagators are trained for either a specific time-independent potential or general potentials that can be time-dependent.

The hyperconnectivity of the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment drastically increases the attack surface and the need for crypto-agility. In addition, the long lifecycle of automotive products demands that not only current but also future attacks are considered. Thus, empowering automotive devices with efficient, robust, and long-term security solutions is challenging. The foreseeable breakthrough of quantum computers and their threat to traditional cryptography requires that automotive devices are able to efficiently implement quantum secure cryptographic mechanisms, also known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). One of the most promising PQC approaches is lattice-based cryptography. Among the seven finalists of the NIST third round post-quantum standardization process, five algorithms (three KEM/encryption and two signature algorithms) belong to the category of lattice-based cryptography. While lattice-based cryptography has been previously integrated in general-purpose microcontrollers, their impact on automotive environments has been neglected. To this end, this work presents two contributions. As a first contribution, we provide a performance exploration of four lattice-based KEM/encryption algorithms implemented on the automotive microcontroller AURIX. The exploration includes the three finalists CRYSTALS-KYBER, NTRU, and Saber, together with ThreeBears. Despite ThreeBears was not selected as a PQC finalist, NIST recommended further investigations in this direction due to interesting security and performance characteristics of the algorithm. Our analysis has shown that all of these algorithms can be implemented on the AURIX microcontroller while achieving a competitive performance. As a second contribution, we explore the improvement of the security level of ThreeBears by extending its error correction capability. © 2021",,10.1016/j.micpro.2021.104379,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119288020&doi=10.1016%2fj.micpro.2021.104379&partnerID=40&md5=39dece05abfac3daa6bafe55de561b7a,Article

The primary aim of grid computing is to combine the power of wide-ranging resources that are very diverse in nature and provide users with essential services to users in the future. Resources are complex and varying in a mobile grid system and the availability is limited for a period of time. With resource mobility in mind, classification is the most challenging and primitive challenge in the mobile grid environment. The previous paradigm outlined the Quantum based approach on Gravitational search Algorithm (QBGSA) for scheduling the task (job) on a mobile computing grid. In any case, it has problem with computational difficulty and execution time. To solve this problem, the proposed system designed an Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) clustering and Natural Exponential Inertia Weight with Artificial Bee Colony (NEIWABC) based scheduling approaches. In this proposed research work, grid server has all the information about mobile grid networks. Once it receiving the task request from user, it verifies the available resource providers. The nodes are clustered by using Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) clustering algorithm and Cluster Head (CH) selection is done using mobile capacity such as storage capacity, computational power. Then the task request is promoting to the selected CH in the cluster. Then the CH schedules the jobs to the appropriate mobiles to respond user.

The hybrid device’s optical responses, such as electromagneticinduced transparency (EIT) and group delay, can be modulated in several ways. First, it is modulated electrically by changing the conductivity and carrier concentrations in graphene. Alternatively, the optical response can be modified by acting on the device temperature sensitivity by switching Nb from a lossy normal phase to a low-loss quantum mechanical phase below the transition temperature (Tc) of Nb. Maximum modulation depths of 57.3% and 97.61% are achieved for EIT and group delay at the THz transmission window, respectively. A comparison is carried out between the Nb-graphene-Nb coupled SRR-based devices with those of Au-graphene-Au SRRs, and significant enhancements of the THz transmission, group delay, and EIT responses are observed when Nb is in the quantum mechanical phase. Such hybrid devices with their reasonably large and tunable slow light bandwidth pave the way for the realization of active optoelectronic modulators, filters, phase shifters, and slow light devices for applications in chip-scale future communication and computation systems. © 2021 by the authors.

388,Scopus,Madbouly et al. (2021),2021,Quantum game application to recovery problem in mobile database,Symmetry,"Mobile Computing (MC) is a relatively new concept in the world of distributed computing that is rapidly gaining traction. Due to the dynamic nature of mobility and the limited bandwidth available on wireless networks, this new computing environment for mobile devices presents significant challenges in terms of fault-tolerant system development. As a consequence, traditional fault-tolerance techniques are inherently inapplicable to these systems. External circumstances often expose mobile systems to failures in communication or data storage. In this article, a quantum game theory-based recovery model is proposed in the case of a mobile host’s failure. Several of the state-of-the-art recovery protocols are selected and analyzed in order to identify the most important variables influencing the recovery mechanism, such as the number of processes, the time needed to send messages, and the number of messages logged-in time. Quantum game theory is then adapted to select the optimal recovery method for the given environment variables using the proposed utility matrix of three players. Game theory is the study of mathematical models of situations in which intelligent rational decision-makers face conflicting interests (alternative recovery procedures). The purpose of this study is to present an adaptive algorithm based on quantum game theory for selecting the most efficient context-aware computing recovery procedure. The transition from a classical to a quantum domain is accomplished in the proposed model by treating strategies as a Hilbert space rather than a discrete set and then allowing for the existence of linear superpositions between classical strategies; this naturally increases the number of possible strategic choices available to each player from a numerable to a continuous set.

Consequently, the physical mechanisms governing the microwave noise figure are of practical interest. In particular, the magnitude of the contribution of thermal noise from the gate at cryogenic temperatures remains unclear owing to a lack of experimental measurements of thermal resistance under these conditions. Here, we report measurements of gate junction temperature and thermal resistance in a HEMT at cryogenic and room temperatures using Schottky thermometry. At temperatures ∼20 K, we observe a nonlinear trend of thermal resistance vs power that is consistent with heat dissipation by phonon radiation. Based on this finding, we consider heat transport by phonon radiation at the low-noise bias and liquid helium temperatures and estimate that the thermal noise from the gate is several times larger than previously assumed owing to self-heating. We conclude that without improvements in thermal management, self-heating results in a practical lower limit for microwave noise figure of HEMTs at cryogenic temperatures. © 2021 Author(s).",,10.1063/5.0063331,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118234598&doi=10.1063%2f5.0063331&partnerID=40&md5=6a4d5de954c8f5a002c5fc6d84762918,Article

The area of Blockchain, Quantum computing, normal sharing of data over the network all uses the techniques of encrypting the data using some sort of keys. As the Machines and technology are becoming more and more powerful, legacy way of handling the communication needs a secure approach. This paper propose an idea of guessing the nonce or key, in such a way that it would evolve with the machines and technology. The Idea of Proposed adaptive algorithm works on challenges and using different challenges, the key is guess. There are three variations of this approach Direct, Separation and Pooling. The Messages are encrypted from the pooled of solved challenge keys and using the proposed techniques, nonce or key is selected mutually. Using Poission distribution, it is found that the identification of key becomes more robust as the level of communication increases. This Methodology allows the flexibility to change or make the challenge more complex depending upon their needs, which indeed increase the probability of guessing. This can also solve the problem of Denial of service(DOS) and spamming.

A threat to these public key cryptographic algorithms is a threat to the entire Internet itself, as algorithms like RSA are the basic building blocks of existing secure Internet communication. Thus, a new area of quantum cryptography emerged, that lead to the development of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms and Quantum-safe Internet protocol Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). These systems, which are generally known as Quantum Cryptographic Systems, have many practical limitations that make them complex and expensive to be implemented or even experimented with, in a real-life scenario. Therefore, to develop new protocols and analyze the feasibility of the existing protocols in a cost-effective manner, we need efficient simulation frameworks.

Although the fundamental technology is not yet mature, research on quantum internet should be conducted. To implement quantum internet, an architecture that describes how quantum nodes are linked to form networks and how protocol functions are vertically composed need to be developed urgently. In this paper, we present a novel design of a cluster-based structure to describe how quantum nodes are interconnected, and how the structure can improve the performance of qubit transmission and reduce the network complexity. The idea of the quantum local area network (QLAN) is proposed as an essential component of the quantum internet. Besides, each quantum repeater links to neighboring repeaters to form a core network, and multiple QLANs are connected through the core network. The core network can be grouped into different hierarchical quantum repeater networks according to needed service requirements. For the sake of interoperability and fast prototyping, we adopt the idea of OSI layering model of the current Internet in the design of quantum internet.

(2021),2021,High-speed batch processing of semidefinite programs with feedforward neural networks,New Journal of Physics,"Semidefinite programming is an important optimization task, often used in time-sensitive applications. Though they are solvable in polynomial time, in practice they can be too slow to be used in online, i.e. real-time applications. Here we propose to solve feasibility semidefinite programs using artificial neural networks (NNs). Given the optimization constraints as an input, a NN outputs values for the optimization parameters such that the constraints are satisfied, both for the primal and the dual formulations of the task. We train the network without having to exactly solve the semidefinite program even once, thus avoiding the possibly time-consuming task of having to generate many training samples with conventional solvers. The NN method is only inconclusive if both the primal and dual models fail to provide feasible solutions. Otherwise we always obtain a certificate, which guarantees false positives to be excluded. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we examine the performance of the method on a hierarchy of quantum information tasks, the Navascués-Pironio-Acín hierarchy applied to the Bell scenario. We demonstrate that the trained NN gives decent accuracy, while showing orders of magnitude increase in speed compared to a traditional solver, once trained. The network does not have to be retrained for similarly structured problems, giving the promise for being a fast solver for these types of problems. © 2021 The Author(s).

Software-defined networking and network function virtualization (SDN/NFV) are two complementary technologies that can be used to ensure that the heterogeneous resources in STINs can be easily managed and deployed. Considering the dual mobility of satellites and ubiquitous users, along with the dynamic requirements of user requests and network resource states, it is challenging to maintain service continuity and high QoE performance in STINs. Thus, we investigate the service migration and reconfiguration scheme, which are of great significance to the guarantee of continuous service provisioning. Specifically, this paper proposes a dynamic service reconfiguration method that can support flexible service configurations on integrated networks, including LEO satellites and ground nodes. We first model the migration cost as an extra delay incurred by service migration and reconfiguration and then formulate the selection processes of the location and migration paths of virtual network functions (VNFs) as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem. Then, we propose a fuzzy logic and quantum genetic algorithm (FQGA) to obtain an approximate optimal solution that can accelerate the solving process efficiently with the benefits of the high-performance computing capacity of QGA.

404,Scopus,Cysewski et al. (2021),2021,Experimental and theoretical screening for green solvents improving sulfamethizole solubility,Materials,"Solubility enhancement of poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients is of crucial importance for drug development and processing. Extensive experimental screening is limited due to the vast number of potential solvent combinations. Hence, theoretical models can offer valuable hints for guiding experiments aimed at providing solubility data. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying quantum-chemistry-derived molecular descriptors, adequate for development of an ensemble of neural networks model (ENNM), for solubility computations of sulfamethizole (SMT) in neat and aqueous binary solvent mixtures. The machine learning procedure utilized information encoded in σ-potential profiles computed using the COSMO-RS approach. The resulting nonlinear model is accurate in backcomputing SMT solubility and allowed for extensive screening of green solvents. Since the experimental characteristics of SMT solubility are limited, the data pool was extended by new solubility measurements in water, five neat organic solvents (acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,4-dioxane, and methanol), and their aqueous binary mixtures at 298.15, 303.15, 308.15, and 313.15 K. Experimentally determined order of decreasing SMT solubility in neat solvents is the following: N,N-dimethylformamide > dimethyl sulfoxide > methanol > acetonitrile > 1,4dioxane >> water, in all studied temperatures. Similar trends are observed for aqueous binary mixtures. Since N,N-dimethylformamide is not considered as a green solvent, the more acceptable replacers were searched for using the developed model. This step led to the conclusion that 4-formylmorpholine is a real alternative to N,N-dimethylformamide, fulfilling all requirements of both high dissolution potential and environmental friendliness. © 2021 by the authors.

Through a specific design for suppressing the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) in the green 2 × 2 μ-LED array with a low polarization-related electric field and flat quantum well band diagram, the green 2 × 2 μ-LED array exhibits a turn-on voltage of 2.5 V and output power of 0.3 mW at 1 A/cm2. The green 2 × 2 μ-LED array also reveals a wavelength shift from 543 nm to 537 nm smaller than that of conventional devices grown on c-plane buffered GaN substrate due to the inhibited QCSE. The 50 μm emission aperture of the green 2 × 2 μ-LED array ensures a lower capacitance for a larger -3 dB modulation bandwidth, which exhibits -1 dB power compression at a larger bias under high-speed operation, as it is less affected by the high resistance of the single μ-LED element. With a specific TO-can+SMA package, the green 2 × 2 μ-LED array exhibits maximal data rates exceeding 1.5 Gbit/s for the non-return-to-zero on-off keying format and beyond 5.02 Gbit/s for the bit-loaded discrete multitone (BL-DMT) format, which is very promising for optical wireless communication. As the sampling rate increases from 4 GSa/s to 16 GSa/s, the μ-LED array's received signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) improves dramatically from 15.4 dB to 12.2 dB. The SNR remains about 15.4 dB, with a matching bit-error ratio (BER) of 2.7 × 10-3, whereas the 10-fold oversampling of the eight-ray quadrature amplitude modulation orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (8-QAM OFDM) data stream with 16 GSa/s appears to reduce the SNR by -3 dB, resulting in a decoded BER of 3.3 × 10-3.

Optical vortex with spiral wave surfaces is a special type of light with intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM). Thus, this vortex can be applied to the development of advanced optics, such as optical tweezers, ultra-resolution microscope, optical communication, and quantum technology. This study demonstrates an optical device known as Bragg–Berry optical vortex generator (BBOVG) with a circularly symmetric chiral photonic structure using an easy-to-implement method by filling a ferroelectric liquid crystal-doped cholesteric liquid crystal (FLC-CLC) material into an indium-tin-oxide-coated cell pre-treated with photoalignment along the azimuthal direction. The BBOVG devices can be operated by dynamically tuning the photonic bandgaps of the opposite-handed FLC-CLCs throughout the full-visible region (400–700 nm) in a low voltage range (≤ 3.0 V) to obtain reflective optical vortices with opposite OAM signs in a full-visible range near room temperature.

However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of sufficient and diverse materials in current materials repositories such as the open quantum materials database (OQMD). Recent progress in deep learning have enabled generative strategies that learn implicit chemical rules for creating hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generative design of novel cubic materials. When trained on 375 749 ternary materials from the OQMD database, the authors show that the model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such materials have been verified by phonon dispersion calculation. Considering the importance of cubic materials in wide applications such as solar panels, the GAN model provides a promising approach to significantly expand existing materials repositories, enabling the discovery of new functional materials via screening.

408,Scopus,Georgiev (2021),2021,Quantum propensities in the brain cortex and free will,BioSystems,"Capacity of conscious agents to perform genuine choices among future alternatives is a prerequisite for moral responsibility. Determinism that pervades classical physics, however, forbids free will, undermines the foundations of ethics, and precludes meaningful quantification of personal biases. To resolve that impasse, we utilize the characteristic indeterminism of quantum physics and derive a quantitative measure for the amount of free will manifested by the brain cortical network. The interaction between the central nervous system and the surrounding environment is shown to perform a quantum measurement upon the neural constituents, which actualize a single measurement outcome selected from the resulting quantum probability distribution. Inherent biases in the quantum propensities for alternative physical outcomes provide varying amounts of free will, which can be quantified with the expected information gain from learning the actual course of action chosen by the nervous system. For example, neuronal electric spikes evoke deterministic synaptic vesicle release in the synapses of sensory or somatomotor pathways, with no free will manifested. In cortical synapses, however, vesicle release is triggered indeterministically with probability of 0.35 per spike. This grants the brain cortex, with its over 100 trillion synapses, an amount of free will exceeding 96 terabytes per second. Although reliable deterministic transmission of sensory or somatomotor information ensures robust adaptation of animals to their physical environment, unpredictability of behavioral responses initiated by decisions made by the brain cortex is evolutionary advantageous for avoiding predators. Thus, free will may have a survival value and could be optimized through natural selection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.biosystems.2021.104474,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109488953&doi=10.1016%2fj.biosystems.2021.104474&partnerID=40&md5=de15aa167b5463913a7fd6932de5ef4c,Article

However, its poor stability restricts further practical applications. Glass as a carrier can solve this problem well while still maintaining excellent luminescent properties. The traditional CsPbBr3 NC glass is obtained by melt-quenching and heat treatment. In this paper, we first propose LiBr-induced the self-crystallization of CsPbBr3 NC in borosilicate glass without heat treatment. We demonstrated that the lithium changes the glass network structure, resulting in a higher aggregation state in the glass. At the same time, the lithium doping increases the degree of phase separation of the glass. Both of these two factors benefit the formation of the CsPbBr3 NC. The self-crystallized CsPBbr3 NC glass has better luminescent properties than NC glass obtained by heat treatment. What is more, the self-crystallized CsPbBr3 NC glass shows good environmental and water stability, especially thermal stability.

Most recently, optically addressable spin qubits in h-BN have been the focus of intensive research due to their unique potential in quantum computation, communication, and sensing. However, the number of high-symmetry, high-spin defects that are desirable for developing spin qubits in h-BN is highly limited. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and quantum embedding theories to show that out-of-plane XNYidimer defects (X, Y = C, N, P, and Si) form a new class of stable C3vspin-triplet defects in h-BN. We find that the dimer defects have a robust3A2ground state and3E excited state, both of which are isolated from the h-BN bulk states. We show that1E and1A shelving states exist and they are positioned between the3E and3A2states for all the dimer defects considered in this study.

The proposed scheme has been successfully implemented to predict the trend of current against the scattering strength with meaningful accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/SISPAD54002.2021.9592557,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119440289&doi=10.1109%2fSISPAD54002.2021.9592557&partnerID=40&md5=b2589c733439a25092002cec7d8f953b,Conference Paper

(2021),2021,Deep learning enabled classification of real-time respiration signals acquired by MoSSe quantum dot-based flexible sensors,Journal of Materials Chemistry B,"Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

In order to compensate for the time drift caused by the Doppler effect and adapt to the unstable optical link in satellite-to-ground QKD, previous demonstrations generally adopted synchronization methods requiring additional hardware. In this paper, we present a novel synchronization method based on the detected quantum photons, thus simplifying additional hardware and reducing the complexity and cost. This method adopts target frequency scanning to realize fast frequency recovery, utilizes polynomial fitting to compensate for the Doppler effect, and takes use of the vacuum state in the decoy-state BB84 protocol to recover the time offset. This method can avoid the influence of synchronization light jitter, thus improving the synchronization precision and the secure keys as well. Successful satellite-to-ground QKD based on this new synchronization scheme has been conducted to demonstrate its feasibility and performance.

These networks have an inherent feature of parallelism that allows them to boost the capacity and enhance the security of communication systems. Recent advances led to the deployment of small- and large-scale quantum communication networks with real quantum hardware. In quantum networks, entanglement is a key resource that allows for data transmission between different nodes. However, to reap the benefits of entanglement and enable efficient quantum communication, the number of generated entangled pairs must be optimized. Indeed, if the entanglement generation rates are not optimized, then some of these valuable resources will be discarded and lost. In this paper, the problem of optimizing the entanglement generation rates and their distribution over a quantum memory is studied. In particular, a quantum network in which users have heterogeneous distances and applications is considered. This problem is posed as a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization problem whose goal is to efficiently utilize the available quantum memory by distributing the quantum entangled pairs in a way that maximizes the user satisfaction. An interior point optimization method is used to solve the optimization problem and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Simulation results show the key design considerations for efficient quantum networks, and the effect of different network parameters on the network performance. © 2021 IEEE",,10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562228,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118190889&doi=10.1109%2fISWCS49558.2021.9562228&partnerID=40&md5=6d974c61176c89e450790e1f1818c336,Conference Paper

(2021),2021,General Method for Classicality Certification in the Prepare and Measure Scenario,PRX Quantum,"Preparing and measuring physical systems are the operational building blocks of any physical experiment, and to describe them is the first purpose of any physical theory. Remarkably, even when only uncharacterized preparation and measurement devices are present, it is sometimes possible to distinguish between the behaviors of quantum and classical systems from only observational data. Certifying the physical origin of measurement statistics in the prepare and measure scenario is of primal importance for developing quantum networks, distributing quantum keys, and certifying randomness, to mention a few applications, but, surprisingly, no general methods to do so are known. We progress on this problem by crafting a general, sufficient condition to certify that a given set of preparations can only generate classical statistics, for any number of generalized measurements. As an application, we employ the method to demonstrate nonclassicality activation in the prepare and measure scenario, also considering its application in random access codes. Following that, we adapt our method to certify, again through a sufficient condition, whether a given set of measurements can never give rise to nonclassical behaviors, irrespective of what preparations they may act upon. This, in turn, allows us to find a large set of incompatible measurements that cannot be used to demonstrate nonclassicality, thus showing incompatibility is not sufficient for nonclassicality in the prepare and measure scenario. © 2021 authors.

As the critical infrastructure for 5G and beyond communications, optical networks can offer a cost-effective solution to QKD deployment utilizing the existing fiber resources. In particular, measurement-device-independent QKD shows its ability to extend the secure distance with the aid of an untrusted relay. Compared to the trusted relay, the untrusted relay has obviously better security, since it does not rely on any assumption on measurement and even allows to be accessed by an eavesdropper. However, it cannot extend QKD to an arbitrary distance like the trusted relay, such that it is expected to be combined with the trusted relay for large-scale QKD deployment. In this work, we study the hybrid trusted/untrusted relay based QKD deployment over optical backbone networks and focus on cost optimization during the deployment phase. A new network architecture of hybrid trusted/untrusted relay based QKD over optical backbone networks is described, where the node structures of the trusted relay and untrusted relay are elaborated. The corresponding network, cost, and security models are formulated. To optimize the deployment cost, an integer linear programming model and a heuristic algorithm are designed. Numerical simulations verify that the cost-optimized design can significantly outperform the benchmark algorithm in terms of deployment cost and security level.

(2021),2021,TSNet: predicting transition state structures with tensor field networks and transfer learning,Chemical Science,"Transition states are among the most important molecular structures in chemistry, critical to a variety of fields such as reaction kinetics, catalyst design, and the study of protein function. However, transition states are very unstable, typically only existing on the order of femtoseconds. The transient nature of these structures makes them incredibly difficult to study, thus chemists often turn to simulation. Unfortunately, computer simulation of transition states is also challenging, as they are first-order saddle points on highly dimensional mathematical surfaces. Locating these points is resource intensive and unreliable, resulting in methods which can take very long to converge. Machine learning, a relatively novel class of algorithm, has led to radical changes in several fields of computation, including computer vision and natural language processing due to its aptitude for highly accurate function approximation. While machine learning has been widely adopted throughout computational chemistry as a lightweight alternative to costly quantum mechanical calculations, little research has been pursued which utilizes machine learning for transition state structure optimization. In this paper TSNet is presented, a new end-to-end Siamese message-passing neural network based on tensor field networks shown to be capable of predicting transition state geometries. Also presented is a small dataset of SN2 reactions which includes transition state structures - the first of its kind built specifically for machine learning. Finally, transfer learning, a low data remedial technique, is explored to understand the viability of pretraining TSNet on widely available chemical data may provide better starting points during training, faster convergence, and lower loss values. Aspects of the new dataset and model shall be discussed in detail, along with motivations and general outlook on the future of machine learning-based transition state prediction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,10.1039/d1sc01206a,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111425895&doi=10.1039%2fd1sc01206a&partnerID=40&md5=f915b9b39a11f52bb08a13a168cfbf75,Article

It is essential for sustainable development, particularly efficient water management practices, to know about the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing were used for monitoring land use changes, whereas artificial neural network cellular automata (ANN-CA) modeling using quantum geographic information systems (QGIS) was performed for prediction of LULC changes. This study investigated the changes in LULC in the Perak River basin for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. The study also provides predictions of future changes for the years 2030, 2040, and 2050. Landsat satellite images were utilized to monitor the land use changes. For the classification of Landsat images, maximum-likelihood supervised classification was implemented. The broad classification defines four main classes in the study area, including (i) waterbodies, (ii) agricultural lands, (iii) barren and urban lands, and (iv) dense forests. The outcomes revealed a considerable reduction in dense forests from the year 2000 to 2020, whereas a substantial increase in barren lands (up to 547.39 km2 ) had occurred by the year 2020, while urban land use has seen a rapid rise. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the validity of classified images, with an overall kappa coefficient of 0.86, 0.88, and 0.91 for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. In addition, ANN-CA simulation results predicted that barren and urban lands will expand in the future at the expense of other classes in the years 2030, 2040, and 2050. However, a considerable decrease will occur in the area of dense forests in the simulated years. The study successfully presents LULC changes and future predictions highlighting significant pattern of land use change in the Perak River basin. This information could be helpful for land use administration and future planning in the region. © 2021 by the authors.

(2021),2021,Faithful entanglement distribution using quantum multiplexing in noisy channel,EPL,"Quantum multiplexing provides us with a powerful approach that can distribute entanglement using only a single photonic pulse to interact with remote quantum memories. In common entanglement distribution protocols, the entanglement purification is often exploited if the distributed entanglement is degraded by the channel noise. In this protocol, we propose a faithful entanglement distribution protocol using quantum multiplexing of photon in a collective noise channel. By designing the encoding and decoding setup, our protocol can resist the collective noise. When the protocol is successful, the parties can obtain two pairs of maximally entangled states. When the protocol fails, the parties can still obtain one pair of maximally entangled state. Our protocol does not require the entanglement purification, so that it is more efficient.

439,Scopus,Hazra et al. (2021),2021,Ring-Resonator-Based Coupling Architecture for Enhanced Connectivity in a Superconducting Multiqubit Network,Physical Review Applied,"Qubit coherence and gate fidelity are typically considered the two most useful metrics for characterizing a quantum processor. An equally useful metric is interqubit connectivity as it minimizes gate count and allows implementing algorithms efficiently with reduced error. However, interqubit connectivity in superconducting processors tends to be limited to nearest neighbor due to practical constraints in typical planar realizations. Here, we introduce a superconducting architecture that uses a ring resonator as a multiqubit coupling element to provide beyond nearest-neighbor connectivity without compromising on coupling uniformity or introducing fabrication complexities. We theoretically analyze the interqubit coupling as a function of frequency for a pair of qubits placed at different positions along the ring resonator and show that for carefully chosen operating frequency and angular spacing between the qubits, the variation of coupling can be minimized. For an operating frequency between the first two resonances of the ring resonator and a 30angular spacing for qubits, we compute interqubit coupling for a device capable of supporting up to 12 qubits with each qubit connected to nine other qubits. Using four qubits positioned strategically in the ring-resonator coupler, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction for all possible angular spacings between the two qubits and demonstrate good agreement. Just like the standard bus resonator coupler, the coupling in the ring-resonator coupler is mediated via virtual photons since the operating frequency is far away from the resonant modes of the ring coupler. This ensures that any small internal loss in the ring resonator does not introduce decoherence during the coupling operation. We also compute extensions of this idea involving larger ring resonators and a multiring system and show the possibility of highly connected networks with larger number of qubits. Apart from being plug and play for existing superconducting architectures, our concept is scalable, adaptable to other platforms and has the potential to significantly accelerate progress in quantum computing, annealing, simulations, and error correction. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.024018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113510488&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevApplied.16.024018&partnerID=40&md5=fd715ed04fb15d8c7ebad31f88f257a4,Article
440,Scopus,Chiti et al. (2021),2021,Towards the quantum internet: Satellite control plane architectures and protocol design,Future Internet,"The creation of the future quantum Internet requires the development of new systems, architectures, and communications protocols. As a matter of fact, the optical fiber technology is affected by extremely high losses; thus, the deployment of a quantum satellite network (QSN) composed of quantum satellite repeaters (QSRs) in low Earth orbit would make it possible to overcome these attenuation problems. For these reasons, we consider the design of an ad hoc quantum satellite backbone based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm with a modular two-tier Control Plane (CP). The first tier of the CP is embedded into a Master Control Station (MCS) on the ground, which coordinates the entire constellation and performs the management of the CP integrated into the constellation itself. This second tier is responsible for entanglement generation and management on the selected path. In addition to defining the SDN architecture in all its components, we present a possible protocol to generate entanglement on the end-to-end (E2E) path. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the developed protocol in terms of the latency required to establish entanglement between two ground stations connected via the quantum satellite backbone. © 2021 by the authors.

(2021),2021,Tight-binding model in optical waveguides: Design principle and transferability for simulation of complex photonics networks,Physical Review A,"Integrated optical waveguides have been widely explored in the context of quantum simulation for various physical models based on paraxial diffraction of light, which are described by an equivalent Schrödinger equation. The physics in these systems can be formulated using the tight-binding models, in which the coupling between the waveguides can be tuned independently in a wide range, providing an excellent platform for simulation of various phenomena. In this work, we build a tight-binding model with parameters transported directly from two coupled waveguides, which are controlled by dielectric constant change, site distance, and geometries. This design principle can greatly save the simulation and experimental cost in real implementation. As compared with results from the exact simulation based on Maxwell equations, our numerical results demonstrate that the physics of the one- or two-dimensional large lattice systems could be well described by our tight-binding model, exhibiting the excellent transferability of the parameters in two coupled waveguides. In addition, some applications are further discussed: we show how to realize the topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, kinked SSH model, and study their associated topological phases and edge modes. Some two-dimensional models based on our tight-binding models are also discussed. Lastly, more intriguing applications, such as nonlinearity or disorder-induced effect and generation of the gauge potential are also briefly discussed. Our work intuitively provides an effective reference route for designing models for experiments and demonstrates the practicality of using the tight-binding approximation to solve complicated models. The design principle demonstrated in this work paves the foundation for the application of optical waveguides based on more complicated models, and will be readily verified experimentally in the near future. ©2021 American Physical Society",,10.1103/PhysRevA.104.023501,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112086322&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.104.023501&partnerID=40&md5=ba6da7a1d683e28b8af58b02140ba9a0,Article

We use one pair of two-photon Bell state or M-photon GHZ state (M< N) to correct the error in the polarization entanglement of an N-photon system. This protocol only uses linear optical elements, so that it is feasible in current experiment. The parties can obtain a high-quality entangled polarization state from each less-entangled N-photon system, by consuming only the Bell state, or the M-photon GHZ state. It is far different from conventional multipartite entanglement purification protocols. It also requires less local operation and classical communication than other purification protocols. Our protocol especially suits for the case where we can precisely know which channel or channels are more noisy.

However, an accurate channel parameter characterization of the PSP-based free-space system has not been established so far. Here, we consider the channel parameter characterization of the PSP-based CVQKD over atmospheric channel. The mode mismatch factor is achieved from combining maximum likelihood with Bayes estimation, leading to a well confidence, whereas the channel transmittance and excess noise can be obtained by using the maximum likelihood estimation. The efficiency of the estimators of the channel parameters is demonstrated by comparing the variances of the estimators with their corresponding quantum Cramér–Rao bounds. We perform numerical simulations of the performance of the PSP-based CVQKD system with experimentally achievable parameters, taking finite-size effect into account based on the characterized channel parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the experiment feasibility of the PSP-based communications over atmospheric channel.

As a significant application of barcoding photons, we introduce code division multiple-access (CDMA) communication systems for various applications. In this context, we introduce and discuss the fundamental principles of a novel quantum CDMA (QCDMA) technique based on spectrally encoding and decoding of continuous-mode quantum light pulses. In particular, we present the mathematical models of various QCDMA modules that are fundamental in describing an ideal and typical QCDMA system, such as quantum signal sources, quantum spectral encoding phase operators, \text{M}\times \text{M} quantum broadcasting star-coupler, quantum spectral phase decoding operators, and the quantum receivers. Following the above discussions, we then elaborate on a QCDMA system with M users. In describing a QCDMA system, this paper considers a unified approach where the input continuous-mode quantum light pulses can take on any form of pure states such as quantum coherent (Glauber) states and quantum number (Fock) states. The mathematical presentation is independent of the form of the input pure quantum states. We show that the spectrally encoded quantum states of the light at the quantum star-coupler output are not, in general, factorized states, except for input Glauber states. For input number states, one can observe features like entanglement and quantum interference. Moreover and interestingly, as a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the quantum signals sent by photon number states obtain complete phase uncertainty at the time of measurement. Therefore, at the receiver output, the multiaccess inter-signal interference vanishes. Due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the received signal intensity at the photodetector's output, right at the time of measurement, changes from coherent detection scheme for input Glauber states to incoherent detection scheme for input number states. We also would like to highlight that the mathematical models and tools developed in this paper, in the context of QCDMA, become very useful for developing and analyzing other quantum multiple-access techniques based on wavelength, space and time domain. Furthermore, our mathematical model is valuable in signal design and data modulations of point-to-point quantum communications, quantum pulse shaping, and quantum radar signals and systems where the inputs are continuous mode quantum signals.

(2021),2021,Numerical evidence for marginal scaling at the integer quantum Hall transition,Annals of Physics,"The integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) is one of the most mysterious members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling behavior near the IQHT has been vigorously studied in experiments and numerical simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin down the precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details and thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, M. Zirnbauer (2019) has conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition, in which linear terms in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow in the fixed point's vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we provide numerical evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations of various network models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality, we show that the finite-size scaling of the disorder averaged longitudinal Landauer conductance is consistent with its recently predicted fixed-point value and a third-order expansion of RG beta functions. In the future, our numerical findings can be checked with analytical results from the conformal field theory. Away from criticality we describe a mechanism that could account for the emergence of an effective critical exponents νeff, which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We further support this idea by numerical determination of νeff in suitably chosen models. © 2021",,10.1016/j.aop.2021.168560,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109431801&doi=10.1016%2fj.aop.2021.168560&partnerID=40&md5=4cfb89990e34f0047d97f48f2cc071e3,Article

Finding potential applications for it has become one of the hot topics in the quantum computing community. With the increase of digital image processing, researchers try to use quantum image processing instead of classical image processing to improve the ability of image processing. Inspired by previous studies on the adversarial quantum circuit learning, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial framework for loading and learning a quantum image.

We numerically simulate the loading and learning of classical images on the MINST database and CIFAR-10 database. In the quantum image processing field, our framework can be used to learn a quantum image as a subroutine of other quantum circuits. Through numerical simulation, our method can still quickly converge under the influence of a variety of noises. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,10.1142/S0217984921503607,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107792273&doi=10.1142%2fS0217984921503607&partnerID=40&md5=9edb67491bbef70580cc990f121c2b0f,Article

In this paper, we describe spray-synthesized CsPbI3 PQD quantum emitters displaying strong photon antibunching and high brightness at room temperature and stable performance under continuous excitation with a high-intensity laser for more than 24 h. Our PQDs provided high single-photon emission rates, exceeding 9 × 106 count/s, after excluding multiexciton emissions and strong photon antibunching, as confirmed by low values of the second-order correlation function g(2)(0) (reaching 0.021 and 0.061 for the best and average PQD performance, respectively). With such high brightness and stability, we applied our PQDs as quantum random number generators, which demonstrably passed all of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's randomness tests. Intriguingly, all of the PQDs exhibited self-healing behavior and restored their PL intensities to greater than half of their initial values after excitation at extremely high intensity. Half of the PQDs even recovered almost all of their initial PL intensity. The robust properties of these spray-synthesized PQDs resulted from high crystallinity and good ligand encapsulation. Our results suggest that spray-synthesized PQDs have great potential for use in future quantum technologies (e.g., quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing). © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acsnano.1c00733,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103797060&doi=10.1021%2facsnano.1c00733&partnerID=40&md5=1295d7151c65545a3e5b138ee518f010,Article

Comparing how these enzymes achieve their reaction promiscuity can yield valuable insights to develop functions from the optimization of latent activities. In this work, we have focused on the promiscuous amidase activity in the esterase from Bacillus subtilis (Bs2) and compared with the same activity in the promiscuous lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB). The study, combining multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, deep machine learning approaches, and experimental characterization of Bs2 kinetics, confirms the amidase activity of Bs2 and CALB. The computational results indicate that both enzymes offer a slightly different reaction environment reflected by electrostatic effects within the active site, thus resulting in a different reaction mechanism during the acylation step. A convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used to understand the conserved amino acids among the evolved protein family and suggest that Bs2 provides a more robust protein scaffold to perform future mutagenesis studies.

(2021),2021,Resolving Jahn-Teller induced vibronic fine structure of silicon vacancy quantum emission in silicon carbide,Physical Review B,"Point defects in semiconductors are promising single-photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum computing, communication, and sensing applications. However, factors such as emission brightness, purity. and indistinguishability are limited by interactions between localized defect states and the surrounding environment. Therefore, it is important to map the full emission spectrum from each SPE, to understand the complex interplay between the different defect configurations, their surroundings, and external perturbations. Herein, we investigate a family of regularly spaced sharp luminescence peaks appearing in the near-infrared portion of photoluminescence (PL) spectra from n-type 4H-SiC samples after irradiation. This periodic emitter family, labeled the L lines, is only observed when the zero-phonon line signatures of the negatively charged Si vacancy (so-called V lines) are present. The L lines appear with 1.45meV and 1.59meV energy spacing after H and He irradiation and increase linearly in intensity with fluence - reminiscent of the intrinsic defect trend. Furthermore, we monitor the dependence of the L-line emission energy and intensity on heat treatments, electric field strength, and PL collection temperature, discussing these data in the context of the L lines. Based on the strong similarity between the irradiation, electric field, and thermal responses of the L and V lines, the L lines are attributed to the Si vacancy in 4H-SiC. The regular and periodic appearance of the L lines provides strong arguments for a vibronic origin explaining the oscillatory multipeak spectrum. To account for the small energy separation of the L lines, we propose a model based on rotations of distortion surrounding the Si vacancy driven by a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevB.104.045120,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109925798&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevB.104.045120&partnerID=40&md5=4090d9dd7a79ba68fb9144b36ff5622c,Article

Those are used as an absorber component of a Compton camera (CC) system under development for ion beam range verification via prompt-gamma imaging. We examined two scintillation crystals: LaBr3:Ce and CeBr3. Each crystal had dimensions of 50.8 mm 50.8 mm 30 mm and was coupled to a 64-fold segmented multi-anode photomultiplier tube (PMT) with an 8 8 pixel arrangement. We determined the spatial resolution for three photon energies of 662, 1.17 and 1.33 MeV obtained from 2D detector scans with tightly collimated 137Cs and 60Co photon sources. With the new algorithm we achieved a spatial resolution for the CeBr3 crystal below 1.11(8) mm and below 0.98(7) mm for the LaBr3:Ce detector for all investigated energies between 662 keV and 1.33 MeV. We thereby improved the performance by more than a factor of 2.5 compared to the previously used categorical average pattern algorithm, which is a variation of the well-established k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The trained CNN has a low memory footprint and enables the reconstruction of up to 104 events per second with only one GPU.

(2021),2021,Automated Landslide-Risk Prediction Using Web GIS and Machine Learning Models,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","Spatial susceptible landslide prediction is the one of the most challenging research areas which essentially concerns the safety of inhabitants. The novel geographic information web (GIW) application is proposed for dynamically predicting landslide risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The automated GIW system is coordinated between machine learning technologies, web technologies, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The new bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithm is presented to forecast landslides. The proposed algorithm consists of 3 major steps, the first of which is the construction of a landslide dataset by using Quantum GIS (QGIS). The second step is to generate the landslide-risk model based on machine learning approaches. Finally, the automated landslide-risk visualization illustrates the likelihood of landslide via Google Maps on the website. Four static factors are considered for landslide-risk prediction, namely, land cover, soil properties, elevation and slope, and a single dynamic factor i.e., precipitation. Data are collected to construct a geospatial landslide database which comprises three historical landslide locations-Phu Chifa at Thoeng District, Ban Pha Duea at Mae Salong Nai, and Mai Salong Nok in Mae Fa Luang District, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Data collection is achieved using QGIS software to interpolate contour, elevation, slope degree and land cover from the Google satellite images, aerial and site survey photographs while the physiographic and rock type are on-site surveyed by experts. The state-of-the-art machine learning models have been trained i.e., linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. Ablation studies have been conducted to determine the optimal parameters setting for each model. An enhancement method based on two-stage classifications has been presented to improve the landslide prediction of LSTM and Bi-LSTM models. The landslide-risk prediction performances of these models are subsequently evaluated using real-time dataset and it is shown that Bi-LSTM with Random Forest (Bi-LSTM-RF) yields the best prediction performance. Bi-LSTM-RF model has improved the landslide-risk predicting performance over LR, ANNs, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM in terms of the area under the receiver characteristic operator (AUC) scores by 0.42, 0.27, 0.46, and 0.47, respectively.

The concept of quantum key pool (QKP) was introduced to offer an effective strategy for storing quantum keys. However, with the loss on its theoretical security due to storing these keys, balancing the storage of quantum keys and the security requirements of QKD-ONs poses a major challenge in their practical deployments. Hence, in this paper a concept of quasi-real-time key provisioning (QRT-KP) is introduced to address the tradeoff between quantum key storage and the degree of security. To satisfy the practical deployment of QRT-KP and the requirement of high-traffic flow, we propose a multi-path based QRT-KP (MP-QRT-KP) algorithm. Simulation results show that the MP-QRT-KP effectively enhances the performance of QKD-ONs in different scenarios, and it turns out that the algorithm performs better than single-path based QRT-KP (SP-QRT-KP) in terms of the success probability of key-allocation requests and key-resources utilization. © 2021 Optical Society of America.",,10.1364/OE.425562,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108460236&doi=10.1364%2fOE.425562&partnerID=40&md5=d8fe513132516f39fb6929edf727f518,Article

To continue securing digital networking in the quantum era, PKI should transition to use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. The cryptography community is developing quantum-resistant primitives/algorithms, studying, and analyzing them for cryptanalysis and improvements. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected finalist algorithms for the post-quantum digital signature cipher standardization, which are Dilithium, Falcon, and Rainbow. We study and analyze the feasibility and the processing performance of these algorithms in memory/size and time/speed when used for PKI, including the key generation from the PKI end entities (e.g., a HTTPS/TLS server), the signing, and the certificate generation by the certificate authority within the PKI. The transition to post-quantum from the classical ciphers incur changes in the parameters in the PKI, for example, Rainbow I significantly increases the certificate size by 163 times when compared with RSA 3072. Nevertheless, we learn that the current X.509 supports the NIST post-quantum digital signature ciphers and that the ciphers can be modularly adapted for PKI. According to our empirical implementations-based study, the post-quantum ciphers can increase the certificate verification time cost compared to the current classical cipher and therefore the verification overheads require careful considerations when using the post-quantum-cipher-based certificates. © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522179,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114961250&doi=10.1109%2fICCCN52240.2021.9522179&partnerID=40&md5=3d4332c3f32221522db03726a708895b,Conference Paper

Its deployment of neural networks serves as an alternative for mitigating the rapidly increased demand for computing resources in electronic platforms. However, it remains a formidable challenge to train the online programmable optical neural networks efficiently, being restricted by the difficulty in obtaining gradient information on a physical device when executing a gradient descent algorithm. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient, physics-agnostic, and closed-loop protocol for training optical neural networks on chip. A gradient-free algorithm, that is, the genetic algorithm, is adopted. The protocol is on-chip implementable, physical agnostic (no need to rely on characterization and offline modeling), and gradient-free. The protocol works for various types of chip structures and is especially helpful to those that cannot be analytically decomposed and characterized.

The discussion focuses on applying currently available technologies and analyzes a concrete example of a D-Wave machine. It is introduced a class of simple spin network states which can be implemented on the Chimera graph architecture of the D-Wave quantum processor. However, extension beyond the currently available quantum processor topologies is required to simulate more sophisticated spin network states. This may inspire new generations of adiabatic quantum computers. A possibility of simulating loop quantum gravity is discussed, and a method of solving a graph non-changing scalar (Hamiltonian) constraint with the use of adiabatic quantum computations is proposed.

The initial mission was to try and replace conventional optical elements by thinner, lightweight equivalents. However, while developing this technology and learning about its strengths and limitations, researchers have identified a myriad of exciting new opportunities. It is therefore a great moment to explore where flat optics can really make a difference and what materials and building blocks are needed to make further progress. Building on its strengths, flat optics is bound to impact computational imaging, active wavefront manipulation, ultrafast spatiotemporal control of light, quantum communications, thermal emission management, novel display technologies, and sensing. In parallel with the development of flat optics, we have witnessed an incredible progress in the large-area synthesis and physical understanding of atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials.

At the core of this network lies the ability to generate and store entanglement at remote, interconnected quantum nodes2. Although various remote physical systems have been successfully entangled3–12, none of these realizations encompassed all of the requirements for network operation, such as compatibility with telecommunication (telecom) wavelengths and multimode operation. Here we report the demonstration of heralded entanglement between two spatially separated quantum nodes, where the entanglement is stored in multimode solid-state quantum memories. At each node a praseodymium-doped crystal13,14 stores a photon of a correlated pair15, with the second photon at telecom wavelengths. Entanglement between quantum memories placed in different laboratories is heralded by the detection of a telecom photon at a rate up to 1.4 kilohertz, and the entanglement is stored in the crystals for a pre-determined storage time up to 25 microseconds. We also show that the generated entanglement is robust against loss in the heralding path, and demonstrate temporally multiplexed operation, with 62 temporal modes. Our realization is extendable to entanglement over longer distances and provides a viable route towards field-deployed, multiplexed quantum repeaters based on solid-state resources. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,10.1038/s41586-021-03481-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107076078&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-021-03481-8&partnerID=40&md5=0d4d822782e07a0bdbd2fc17c2b49af6,Article

474,Scopus,Kaspschak & Meißner (2021),2021,Neural network perturbation theory and its application to the Born series,Physical Review Research,"Deep learning using the eponymous deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an attractive approach towards various data-based problems of theoretical physics in the past decade. There has been a clear trend to deeper architectures containing increasingly more powerful and involved layers. Contrarily, Taylor coefficients of DNNs still appear mainly in the light of interpretability studies, where they are computed at most to first order. However, especially in theoretical physics, numerous problems benefit from accessing higher orders, as well. This gap motivates a general formulation of neural network (NN) Taylor expansions. Restricting our analysis to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and introducing quantities we refer to as propagators and vertices, both depending on the MLP's weights and biases, we establish a graph-theoretical approach. Similarly to Feynman rules in quantum field theories, we can systematically assign diagrams containing propagators and vertices to the corresponding partial derivative. Examining this approach for S-wave scattering lengths of shallow potentials, we observe NNs to adapt their derivatives mainly to the leading order of the target function's Taylor expansion. To circumvent this problem, we propose an iterative NN perturbation theory. During each iteration we eliminate the leading order, such that the next-to-leading order can be faithfully learned during the subsequent iteration. After performing two iterations, we find that the first- and second-order Born terms are correctly adapted during the respective iterations. Finally, we combine both results to find a proxy that acts as a machine-learned second-order Born approximation. © 2021 authors.

In this work, we experimentally study wave redirection, localization, and non-reciprocity in an asymmetric network of two nonlinear lattices with weak linear inter-lattice coupling. We report on the design, fabrication, and system identification of coupled lattices with essentially nonlinear next-neighbor intra-lattice coupling and on their unusual nonlinear acoustics. By weakly coupling the lattices and introducing structural disorder in one of them, we experimentally prove the realization of irreversible breather redirection between lattices governed by a macroscopic analog of the quantum Landau-Zener tunneling effect. In the experiments performed, the input energy is applied by impulse (broadband) excitation, and the resulting acoustical mechanism for wave redirection is in the form of propagating breathers, that is, localized oscillating wave packets formed by the synergy of nonlinearity and dispersion. Moreover, we study the non-reciprocal acoustics of the experimental lattice system by applying separate impulses at each of its four terminals and investigate the tunability with the energy of the resulting acoustic non-reciprocity by systematically varying the impulse intensity. The reported experimental results show that the weakly coupled, disordered, and nonlinear lattice system has wave tailoring properties that are tunable with energy.

Altogether, 195 carefully selected rovibrational transitions are probed. The ultrahigh sensitivity of NICE-OHMS permits the observation of lines with room-temperature absorption intensities as low as 10−27 cm molecule−1, while the superb resolution enables the detection of a doublet with a separation of only 286(17) kHz. While the NICE-OHMS experiments are performed in the near-infrared window of 7000-7350 cm−1, the lines observed allow the determination of all the pure rotational energies of H218O corresponding to J values up to 8, where J is the total rotational quantum number. Both network and quantum theory have been employed to facilitate the measurement campaign and the full exploitation of the lines resolved. For example, to minimize the experimental effort, the transitions targeted for observation were selected via the spectroscopic-network-assisted precision spectroscopy (SNAPS) scheme built upon the extended Ritz principle, the theory of spectroscopic networks, and an underlying dataset of quantum chemical origin. To ensure the overall connection of the ultraprecise rovibrational lines for both nuclear-spin isomers of H218O, the NICE-OHMS transitions are augmented with six accurate microwave lines taken from the literature. To produce absolute ortho-H218O energies, the lowest ortho energy is determined to be 23.754 904 61(19) cm−1.

488,Scopus,Usman (2021),2021,Recent progress in atomistic modelling and simulations of donor spin qubits in silicon,Computational Materials Science,"Electron or nuclear spins associated with dopant atoms, such as phosphorus impurities in silicon (Si:P), have been shown to form excellent qubits with promising potential for scale-up towards a fault-tolerant quantum computer architecture. The remarkable progress in the design and characterisation of Si:P qubits and quantum gates has been led by recent experimental demonstrations. Equally importantly, advances in theoretical modelling and simulations over a number of years have underpinned the experimental efforts through the fundamental understanding of dopant physics and by providing crucial interpretation of the experimental evidence. This brief review article provides highlights of our research on developing atomistic theoretical methods and their application to the understanding, characterisation and scale-up of Si:P qubits in silicon. We have established a state-of-the-art theoretical framework which is capable of performing electronic structure simulations over millions of atoms. This includes a comprehensive set of central-cell corrections within atomistic tight-binding theory to simulate dopant energy spectra and electronic wave functions with high precision. When integrated with Bardeen's tunnelling formalism and Chen's derivative rule, the theoretical simulations were able to reproduce the measured spatially resolved scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) images of dopant wave functions, providing an unprecedented access to the dopant physics in silicon. A systematic examination of the STM image features (brightness and symmetry) allowed pinpointing of the dopant atom positions in silicon lattice with an exact atom precision and for dopant depths up to 5 nm below the silicon surface. The scale-up of the metrology technique was demonstrated by training a machine learning algorithm such as convolutional neural network. For the design and implementation of high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gates, we investigated exchange interaction between dopant pairs and showed that the application of a small lattice strain could provide a full control in the presence of one-lattice site donor position variations. The state-of-the-art computational capability developed by our team is a culmination of more than five years of research efforts – it has been well-benchmarked against several different experimental measurements and is expected to play an important role in design and characterisation of quantum gates and scale-up architectures in the coming years. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.commatsci.2021.110280,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103560678&doi=10.1016%2fj.commatsci.2021.110280&partnerID=40&md5=2043f25ab278ba6608e49d714d89b6f1,Article

Various quantum information protocols with diverse functionalities have been proposed and implemented. However, in general, the present quantum information system can only carry out a single information protocol or deal with a single communication task, which limits its practical application in the future. Therefore, it is essential to develop a multifunctional platform compatible with multiple different quantum information protocols. In this Letter, by utilizing an all-optical platform consisting of a gain-tunable parametric amplifier, a beam splitter, and an entanglement source, we experimentally realize the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol, which links the all-optical quantum teleportation protocol and the optimal 1→N coherent state cloning protocol. As a result, these three protocols, which have different physical essences and functionalities, are implemented in a single all-optical machine. In particular, we demonstrate that the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol can enhance the state transfer fidelity compared with all-optical quantum teleportation under the same strength of entanglement.

They are always under development and new versions continually come to the market. Though the basic operation principles have stayed nearly the same over the last 100 years, new technology has allowed for advancements in the development of components, and new systems find specific applications. Superconducting materials are widely used, for example in motors, magnets, cavities, and transformers, and are sometimes also used for typical components of radar and communication systems, like antennas, filters, and logical elements. Superconducting components significantly change the operation of whole systems, and thorough understanding of operational principles is of paramount importance for correct design. In this book, the recent developments of cryogenic receivers over the last 20 years are outlined. Special attention is given to the very specialized technologies, like Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) logics, or electrically small active antennas based on SQUID/bi-SQUID/SQIF operational principles. The classical applications, like superconducting filters or cryogenically cooled Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA), are considered in detail. Though the book is considered as a review on recent developments of cryogenic receivers to facilitate an understanding of operational principles, many examples with estimations are given. The reliability of cryogenic receivers strongly depends on the mechanical and cryogenic designs, and many practical examples and solutions are also presented.

The EIT consists of two fields, namely a strong control and weak probe fields that interact with the medium. Fast-optical switching of the probe is achieved by applying a pulsed control field, which relies on both steady-state and transient density matrices. The effects of four significant parameters of interest, i.e., Rabi frequency of the control field, EIT nanocrystal density, FBG length, and spontaneous decay rate, have been extensively investigated to optimize the probe transmission. Subsequently, the time-dependent density matrix is solved to obtain the response time of the FBG-EIT switch. Eventually, FBG is modeled such that low index layers contain EIT material and the high index layers do not. The FBG-EIT switch satisfies the criteria of maximum transmission and minimum rise time to give out the optimal operational condition. Despite the optical switching is in OFF mode at Wc=0 THz demonstrating a high FBG reflectance, the reflectance suddenly vanishes at a certain Ωscto satisfy the equivalence of low and high refractive indices (switching ON). Therefore, a fast-optical switch is envisaged operating as large as 100 GHz in theory. The future applications of the FBG- EIT include the fast Q-switching of fiber lasers, ultra-fast modulation, optical quantum communication, and high speed optical processing and computation. © 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,10.1364/OSAC.415468,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105949578&doi=10.1364%2fOSAC.415468&partnerID=40&md5=fca0dc98ae1c3c856984c66eb336cee4,Article

(2021),2021,Spectroscopic Signatures of MQ-Resins in Silicone Elastomers,Macromolecules,"Polysiloxane elastomers have a large application space due to their versatile cross-linking chemistry and highly tunable physical and mechanical properties. One approach for improving the mechanical integrity of commercial polysiloxane ""silicone""elastomers while maintaining their optical transparency is the addition of small, silicone-resin molecules to the network. However, both the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) network and the silicone-resin particles have an amorphous structure and complex chemistry, which makes the characterization of their structural properties and segmental network dynamics difficult. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of model silicone networks modified with a specific class of silicone-resin known as MQ-resin using Raman and advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods. Raman spectroscopy was successfully used to quantify the contribution of the MQ-resin to the network, to determine the type of MQ-resin present in the network, and to investigate the completeness of the network cross-linking reaction. Solid-state and 1H double-quantum (DQ) NMR spectroscopies were used not only as a detection method for the MQ-resins but also to quantify changes in the segmental dynamics of the network as a function of MQ-resin concentration. The combination of Raman and NMR spectroscopies describes a series of samples where the MQ-resin particles and PDMS chains maintain their independent segmental dynamics up to high concentrations of MQ-resins (40-50% MQ), where the physical properties of the resin dominate the physical properties of the overall network. The results from our spectroscopic analyses are consistent with the results from macroscopic characterization techniques such as solvent uptake and mechanical testing. The spectroscopic insights into the structure-property relationships of PDMS-MQ composites presented in this study are a valuable tool not only for the synthesis and reverse engineering of future generations of commercial silicone elastomers but also for understanding the mechanisms of aging and degradation over the material lifetime. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.macromol.1c00086,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106418344&doi=10.1021%2facs.macromol.1c00086&partnerID=40&md5=ad4bd0305a22a7e631d611c44b75f334,Article

A crucial aspect in such approach is the stringent demand on communication among cores when qubits need to interact, which conditions the scalability potential of these architectures. In this work, we address the question of how the cost of the communication among cores impacts on the viability of the quantum multi-core approach. Methodologically, we consider a design space in which architectural variables (number of cores, number of qubits per core), application variables for several quantum benchmarks (number of qubits, number of gates, percentage of two-qubit gates) and inter-core communication latency are swept along with the definition of a figure of merit. This approach yields both a qualitative understanding of trends in the design space and companion dimensioning guidelines for the architecture, including optimal points, as well as quantitative answers to the question of beyond which communication performance levels the multi-core architecture pays off.

(2021),2021,Continuous-variable quantum key distribution coexisting with classical signals on few-mode fiber,Optics Express,"Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) holds an advantage of well compatibility with classical coherent optical communications. However, there exists a performance trade-off between CVQKD and classical communication on single-mode fiber (SMF) because of the spontaneous Raman scattering. Space-division multiplexing (SDM) technique may provide a feasible way to mitigate this performance trade-off in short-distance communication while CVQKD coexisting with classical signals on few-mode fiber (FMF). Here, we examine the feasibility of CVQKD coexisting with classical signals on FMF and analyze the noise impact in weak coupling regime. We find that the inter-mode crosstalk generated from the mode coupling and re-coupling between modes and the group delay spread originated from the differential group delay (DGD) contribute the main noise sources. DGD may become one of the main limits for FMF-based CVQKD towards high-speed system. In addition, a well channel wavelength management is needed to suppress the inter-mode four-wave-mixing for achieving the positive secret key rates. The numerical simulations identify the key parameters for CVQKD system, enabling a helpful insight for realizing security analysis of the Gaussian modulated coherent state protocol. It shows that CVQKD coexisting with high power classical signals on FMF is feasible to implement with standard telecommunication components and able to operate at higher secret key rates.

499,Scopus,Tachibana et al. (2021),2021,An engineered biliverdin-compatible cyanobacteriochrome enables a unique ultrafast reversible photoswitching pathway,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are promising optogenetic tools for their diverse absorption properties with a single compact cofactor-binding domain. We previously uncovered the ultrafast reversible photoswitching dynamics of a red/green photoreceptor AnPixJg2, which binds phycocyanobilin (PCB) that is unavailable in mammalian cells. Biliverdin (BV) is a mammalian cofactor with a similar structure to PCB but exhibits redder absorption. To improve the AnPixJg2 feasibility in mammalian applications, AnPixJg2_BV4 with only four mutations has been engineered to incorporate BV. Herein, we implemented femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) and ground state femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (GS-FSRS) to uncover transient electronic dynamics on molecular time scales and key structural motions responsible for the photoconversion of AnPixJg2_BV4 with PCB (Bpcb) and BV (Bbv) cofactors in comparison with the parent AnPixJg2 (Apcb). Bpcb adopts the same photoconversion scheme as Apcb, while BV4 mutations create a less bulky environment around the cofactor D ring that promotes a faster twist. The engineered Bbv employs a reversible clockwise/counterclockwise photoswitching that requires a two-step twist on ~5 and 35 picosecond (ps) time scales. The primary forward Pfr → Po transition displays equal amplitude weights between the two processes before reaching a conical intersection. In contrast, the primary reverse Po → Pfr transition shows a 2:1 weight ratio of the ~35 ps over 5 ps component, implying notable changes to the D-ring-twisting pathway. Moreover, we performed pre-resonance GS-FSRS and quantum calculations to identify the Bbv vibrational marker bands at ~659,797, and 1225 cm−1. These modes reveal a stronger H-bonding network around the BV cofactor A ring with BV4 mutations, corroborating the D-ring-dominant reversible photoswitching pathway in the excited state. Implementation of BV4 mutations in other PCB-binding GAF domains like AnPixJg4, AM1_1870g3, and NpF2164g5 could promote similar efficient reversible photoswitching for more directional bioimaging and optogenetic applications, and inspire other bioengineering advances. © 2021 by the authors.

However, current PCNs proposals either heavily rely on special scripting features of the underlying blockchain (e.g. Hash Time Lock Contracts) or are tailored to a handful of digital signature schemes, such as Schnorr or ECDSA signatures. This leaves us in an unsatisfactory situation where many currencies that are being actively developed and use different signature schemes cannot enjoy the benefits of a PCN.In this work, we investigate whether we can construct PCNs assuming the minimal ability of a blockchain to verify a digital signature, for any signature scheme. In answering this question in the affirmative, we introduce the notion of lockable signatures, which constitutes the cornerstone of our PCN protocols. Our approach is generic and the PCN protocol is compatible with any digital signature scheme, thus inheriting all favorable properties of the underlying scheme that are not offered by Schnorr/ECDSA (e.g. aggregatable signatures or post-quantum security).While the usage of generic cryptographic machinery makes our generic protocol impractical, we view it as an important feasibility result as it may serve as the basis for constructing optimized protocols for specific signature schemes. To substantiate this claim, we design a highly efficient PCN protocol for the special case of Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. BLS signatures enjoy many unique features that make it a viable candidate for a blockchain, e.g. short, unique, and aggregatable signatures. Yet, prior to our work, no PCN was known to be compatible with it (without requiring an advanced scripting language). The cost of our PCN is dominated by a handful of calls to the BLS algorithms. Our concrete evaluation of these basic operations shows that users with commodity hardware can process payments with minimal overhead. © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/SP40001.2021.00065,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115099714&doi=10.1109%2fSP40001.2021.00065&partnerID=40&md5=d46e2034e914ef5b58b83bf4924233df,Conference Paper

Most of the pioneering works focused on atomic diffusion as the dominant impact on the retrieved pattern in an atom-based memory. In this work, we demonstrate that the unsynchronized Larmor precession of atoms in the inhomogeneous magnetic field dominates the distortion of the pattern stored in a cold-atom-based memory. We find that this distortion effect can be eliminated by applying a strong uniform polarization magnetic field. By mapping signal light into a spin wave between a pair of clock states, the destructive interference between different spin-wave components is diminished, and the stored localized patterns are synchronized further in a single spin-wave component; then, an obvious enhancement in preserving patterns for a long time is obtained.

Numerical simulations of the temporal waveform, threshold value, and gain coefficient of SBS as a function of temperature, pressure, and attenuation coefficient, respectively, are performed by employing distributed noise model and coupled wave equations. A temperature-pressure simulator was designed to carry out the experimental measurements to validate the numerical simulations. We show that the threshold value of SBS increases with the increases of pressure and attenuation coefficient and decreases with the increase of temperature, while the gain coefficient of SBS shows the reverse change trend. We find that the temperature and attenuation coefficient have greater effect on threshold value and gain coefficient of SBS than that of pressure.

In this paper, we study thermal imaging as an environment localization task, in which thermal images are modeled as ensembles of Gaussian phase insensitive channels with identical transmissivity, and pixels possess properties according to background (cold) or target (warm) thermal channels. Via the teleportation stretching of adaptive quantum protocols, we derive ultimate limits on the precision of pattern classification of abstract, binary thermal image spaces, and show that quantum-enhanced strategies may be used to provide significant quantum advantage over known optimal classical strategies. The environmental conditions and necessary resources for which advantage may be obtained are studied and discussed. We then numerically investigate the use of quantum-enhanced statistical classifiers, where quantum sensors are used in conjunction with machine-learning image classification methods. Proving definitive advantage in the low-loss regime, this work motivates the use of quantum-enhanced sources for short-range thermal imaging and detection techniques for future quantum technologies. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.103.052406,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105667964&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.103.052406&partnerID=40&md5=e2f1ac0e3b98ca1eae5c582f0dfa8ded,Article

Photon transmission loss is one of the main obstacles of quantum communication, which can reduce the communication efficiency and even threaten the security. In the paper, we propose a feasible noiseless linear amplification (NLA) protocol for protecting the single-photon qudit and two-photon hyperentanglement encoded in polarization and double-longitudinal momentum degrees of freedom (DOFs). The NLA protocol is in linear optics, and especially, it adopts practical imperfect single photon sources to generate auxiliary photons.

During the photon transmission in practical noisy channels, photon qudits may suffer from photon transmission loss, which largely limits their application. In this paper, we propose a practical noiseless linear amplification (NLA) protocol for protecting the single-photon qudit encoded in polarization and double-longitudinal momentum DOFs.

(2021),2021,Group Transference Techniques for the Estimation of the Decoherence Times and Capacities of Quantum Markov Semigroups,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,"Capacities of quantum channels and decoherence times both quantify the extent to which quantum information can withstand degradation by interactions with its environment. However, calculating capacities directly is known to be intractable in general. Much recent work has focused on upper bounding certain capacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from operator theory. In the meantime, there has also been substantial recent progress on estimating decoherence times with techniques from analysis and geometry, even though many hard questions remain open. In this article, we introduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called transferred channels, which are built through representation theory from a classical Markov kernel defined on a compact group. In particular, we study two subclasses of such kernels: Hörmander systems on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on finite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing channel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on d qubits. Some of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels that randomly swap subsystems. We then extend tools developed in earlier work by Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of the classical Markov kernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different non-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article is the application of this transference principle to the estimation of decoherence time, of private and quantum capacities, of entanglement-assisted classical capacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking times, defined as the first time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking. Moreover, our estimates hold for non-ergodic channels such as the collective decoherence channels, an important scenario that has been overlooked so far because of a lack of techniques. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/TIT.2021.3065452,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102697913&doi=10.1109%2fTIT.2021.3065452&partnerID=40&md5=593c0e57fe61c2be601a2fef97d4bb2e,Article

In particular, the superpositions of OAM patterns are significant in classical physics and quantum science. The flexible control of spin angular momentum (SAM) to OAM can provide more freedom for the design of multifunctional devices. Here, a kind of dielectric metasurface is proposed that generates polarization-controllable superpositions of OAM patterns in the terahertz (THz) band, which is achieved by the interleaving of anisotropic and isotropic meta-atoms. The conversions of arbitrary SAM to OAM have been realized by combining Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) and propagation phase. Not only multiple superposition states of OAM can be generated in the transverse polarization, but also two superposition states of OAM with arbitrary topological charges can be realized in the longitudinal polarization. Several metasurfaces have been designed to demonstrate the multifunctional design, and the feasibility of the theory has been verified in the experiment. Such multifunctional design can find applications in particle manipulation, communication, harmonic generation, and other fields. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",,10.1002/adom.202002007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102202476&doi=10.1002%2fadom.202002007&partnerID=40&md5=b1b70fd9d46e34d750966ef36cac61ac,Article

While tremendous progress has been made over the years, efficient phase-shifting modulators are challenged with fundamental tradeoffs, such as voltage-length, index change-losses or energy-bandwidth, and no single solution available checks all boxes. While voltage-driven phase modulators, such as based on lithium niobate, offer low loss and high speed operation, their footprint of 10's of cm-scale is prohibitively large, especially for density-critical applications, for example in photonic neural networks. Ignoring modulators for quantum applications, where insertion loss is critical, in this work we distinguish between current versus voltage-driven modulators. We focus on the former, since current-based schemes of emerging thin electro-optical materials have shown unity-strong index modulation suitable for heterogeneous integration into foundry waveguides. Here, we provide an in-depth ab-initio analysis of obtainable modulator performance based on heterogeneously integrating low-dimensional materials, i.e., graphene, thin films of indium tin oxide, and transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers into a plurality of optical waveguide designs atop silicon photonics. Using the fundamental modulator tradeoff of energy-bandwidth-product as a design-quality quantifier, we show that a small modal cross section, such as given by plasmonic modes, enables high-performance operation, physically realized by arguments on charge-distribution and low electrical resistance. An in-depth design understanding of phase-modulator performance, beyond doped-junctions in silicon, offers opportunities for micrometer-compact yet energy-bandwidth-ratio constrained modulators with timely opportunities to hardware-accelerate applications beyond data communication towards photonic machine intelligence, for instance; where both performance and integration-density are critical. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/JSTQE.2020.3041835,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097953810&doi=10.1109%2fJSTQE.2020.3041835&partnerID=40&md5=7d319efe53de40d5e05f80a291677696,Article

Namely, GO described by the bespoke forcefield is found to disrupt the hydrogen bonding network at the interface by playing a more dynamic role in accepting and donating hydrogen bonds from water. Furthermore, with the bespoke forcefield, we find preferential adsorption of ions to carboxyl functional groups and a similar mean adsorption half-life for Na+ and Cl− ions around GO.

(2021),2021,Computational Infrared Spectroscopy of 958 Phosphorus-Bearing Molecules,Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences,"Phosphine is now well-established as a biosignature, which has risen to prominence with its recent tentative detection on Venus. To follow up this discovery and related future exoplanet biosignature detections, it is important to spectroscopically detect the presence of phosphorus-bearing atmospheric molecules that could be involved in the chemical networks producing, destroying or reacting with phosphine. We start by enumerating phosphorus-bearing molecules (P-molecules) that could potentially be detected spectroscopically in planetary atmospheres and collecting all available spectral data. Gaseous P-molecules are rare, with speciation information scarce. Very few molecules have high accuracy spectral data from experiment or theory; instead, the best current spectral data was obtained using a high-throughput computational algorithm, RASCALL, relying on functional group theory to efficiently produce approximate spectral data for arbitrary molecules based on their component functional groups. Here, we present a high-throughput approach utilizing established computational quantum chemistry methods (CQC) to produce a database of approximate infrared spectra for 958 P-molecules. These data are of interest for astronomy and astrochemistry (importantly identifying potential ambiguities in molecular assignments), improving RASCALL's underlying data, big data spectral analysis and future machine learning applications. However, this data will probably not be sufficiently accurate for secure experimental detections of specific molecules within complex gaseous mixtures in laboratory or astronomy settings. We chose the strongly performing harmonic ωB97X-D/def2-SVPD model chemistry for all molecules and test the more sophisticated and time-consuming GVPT2 anharmonic model chemistry for 250 smaller molecules. Limitations to our automated approach, particularly for the less robust GVPT2 method, are considered along with pathways to future improvements. Our CQC calculations significantly improve on existing RASCALL data by providing quantitative intensities, new data in the fingerprint region (crucial for molecular identification) and higher frequency regions (overtones, combination bands), and improved data for fundamental transitions based on the specific chemical environment. As the spectroscopy of most P-molecules have never been studied outside RASCALL and this approach, the new data in this paper is the most accurate spectral data available for most P-molecules and represent a significant advance in the understanding of the spectroscopic behavior of these molecules. © Copyright © 2021 Zapata Trujillo, Syme, Rowell, Burns, Clark, Gorman, Jacob, Kapodistrias, Kedziora, Lempriere, Medcraft, O'Sullivan, Robertson, Soares, Steller, Teece, Tremblay, Sousa-Silva and McKemmish.",,10.3389/fspas.2021.639068,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109977528&doi=10.3389%2ffspas.2021.639068&partnerID=40&md5=1a8eb940e1fbaeeed9b49bcd851de78f,Article

524,Scopus,Fazili et al. (2021),2021,Novel Parity Generator and Detector Design using Quantum Dots,"2021 6th International Conference for Convergence in Technology, I2CT 2021","At the beginning of the era of fabrication of the digital logic circuits using Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors it was well predicted by Moore that every 24 months the transistor density doubles on the same sized fabricated chip. But now what we see that we have reached a particular stage where if we further increase the transistor density, we have to integrate transistors at atomic sizes which possess a big challenge in front of us as we now have to consider the effects of the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. Hence, due to these limitations, Moore's law is now being violated. One of the applications of Quantum Physics which is called Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (also referred to as QCA) is now used to implement digital circuits. Using this technique, the information is tunnelled from one end to another without the actual flow of current thus having low power consumption and extremely small size of the order of nm. This technique is different from any previously developed technique as it uses the help of quantum tunnelling of electrons from one cell to another for the transfer of information. Also setting it apart from any conventional fabrication technique is its high-frequency operation of the order of THz and no short channel effect. The above-mentioned features make it one of the best contenders for the advanced future computing device fabrication processes. In this research paper we have designed a 2-input parity generator and 4-input parity detector and then scaled them realize practical purpose 8 bit and 16-bit communication parity generator and checker. We have reported the simulated results to be on average 20-25% efficient and better from any previously designed circuit. © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/I2CT51068.2021.9418120,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106520382&doi=10.1109%2fI2CT51068.2021.9418120&partnerID=40&md5=4fe777f4c0bc84134522013ff5ece286,Conference Paper
525,Scopus,Li et al. (2021),2021,Strong photon blockade in an all-fiber emitter-cavity quantum electrodynamics system,Physical Review A,"We present an all-fiber emitter-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) scheme which makes it possible to realize the strong photon blockade phenomenon in the strong coupling regime. To begin with, we study the emitter-cavity system where the two-level emitter and cavity are driven by a laser field under different driving strengths, respectively. Then, we theoretically derive that through driving the single-mode nanofiber cavity and a single two-level emitter simultaneously with two classical fields, the photon antibunching effect and the intracavity mean photon number will be tremendously enhanced. Compared with the systems driving an emitter or the cavity, respectively, the second-order correlation function at zero time decay g(2)(0) in our system can reach the minimum value as 0.0003, which is much smaller than a single-emitter-cavity QED system of emitter drive or cavity drive. In particular, under the condition of quantum interference model, the strong phenomenon of photon antibunching can be flexibly reached by controlling of the intensity relationship between the dual-pumping fields in the strong coupling regime. Our proposal can be achieved in the near future and has great potential applications in high-quality single-photon sources and quantum communication processing. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.103.043724,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105097004&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.103.043724&partnerID=40&md5=6019a71b8756a1f19b7a5bfaf90ec430,Article

One of the promising technologies of interest is the generation of entangled photon pairs based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in LNs. In this paper, we investigated, theoretically and numerically, Type II SPDC in two kinds of LNs—undoped and 5-mol% MgO doped LNs. In each case, both non-poled and periodically poled crystals were considered. The technique is based on the SPDC under Type II extended phase matching, where the phase matching and the group velocity matching are simultaneously achieved between interacting photons. The proposed approach has not yet been reported for LNs. We discussed all factors required to generate photon pairs in LNs, in terms of the beam propagation direction, the spectral position of photons, and the corresponding effective nonlinearities and walk-offs. We showed that the spectral positions of the generated photon pairs fall into the mid-infrared region with high potential for free-space quantum communication, spectroscopy, and high-sensitivity metrology. The joint spectral analyses showed that photon pairs can be generated with high purities of 0.995–0.999 with proper pump filtering. © 2021 by the authors.

527,Scopus,Qi & Jing (2021),2021,Magnon-assisted photon-phonon conversion in the presence of structured environments,Physical Review A,"Quantum conversion or interface is one of the most prominent protocols in quantum information processing and quantum state engineering. We propose a photon-phonon conversion protocol in a hybrid magnomechanical system comprising a microwave optical mode, a driven magnon mode, and a mechanical-vibrating mode, which has attracted much interest and is expected to become a building block of the future quantum information network due to its controllability in coupling strengths. The microwave photons in the optical cavity are coupled to the magnons by the Zeeman interaction, and the latter are coupled to the mechanical phonons by the magnetostrictive interaction. With a strong photon-magnon interaction and a strong driving on the magnon, an effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe the conversion between photons and phonons near their resonant point. The cavity-magnon system can then play the role of quantum memory. Moreover, the faithfulness of the photon-phonon conversion is estimated in terms of fidelities for state evolution and state-independent transfer. The former is discussed in the Lindblad master equation, taking account of the leakages of photons, phonons, and magnons into consideration. The latter is derived by the Heisenberg-Langevin equation considering the non-Markovian noise from the structured environments for both optical and mechanical modes. The state-evolution fidelity is found to be robust to the weak leakage. The transfer fidelity can be maintained by the Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments of the photons and is insensitive to the 1/f noise of the phonons. Our work thus provides an interesting application for the magnon system as a photon-phonon converter in the microwave regime. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.103.043704,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104541858&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.103.043704&partnerID=40&md5=52e56c1bb8ce4ab98122ef0285d8f062,Article

Several theoretical measurement schemes have already been proposed to increase its feasibility, using a shared maximally-entangled ancilla. We present a new approach to this problem, using the language of generalized quantum measurements, to show that it is actually possible to measure a nonlocal spin product observable without necessarily requiring a maximally-entangled ancilla. This approach opens the door to more economical arbitrary-strength nonlocal measurements, with applications ranging from nonlocal weak values to possible new tests of Bell inequalities. The relation between measurement strength and the amount of ancillary entanglement needed is made explicit, bringing a new perspective on the links that tie quantum nonlocality, entanglement and information transmission together. © 2021 The Author(s).

529,Scopus,Verdel et al. (2021),2021,Variational classical networks for dynamics in interacting quantum matter,Physical Review B,"Dynamics in correlated quantum matter is a hard problem, as its exact solution generally involves a computational effort that grows exponentially with the number of constituents. While remarkable progress has been witnessed in recent years for one-dimensional systems, much less has been achieved for interacting quantum models in higher dimensions, since they incorporate an additional layer of complexity. In this work, we employ a variational method that allows for an efficient and controlled computation of the dynamics of quantum many-body systems in one and higher dimensions. The approach presented here introduces a variational class of wave functions based on complex networks of classical spins akin to artificial neural networks, which can be constructed in a controlled fashion. We provide a detailed prescription for such constructions and illustrate their performance by studying quantum quenches in one- and two-dimensional models. In particular, we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a genuinely interacting two-dimensional lattice gauge theory, the quantum link model, for which we have recently shown - employing the technique discussed thoroughly in this paper - that it features disorder-free localization dynamics [P. Karpov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 130401 (2021)10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.130401]. The present work not only supplies a framework to address purely theoretical questions but also could be used to provide a theoretical description of experiments in quantum simulators, which have recently seen an increased effort targeting two-dimensional geometries. Importantly, our method can be applied to any quantum many-body system with a well-defined classical limit. © 2021 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

In this article, we show that suitable spatial modulations of the surface resistance between positive (i.e., loss) and negative (i.e., gain) values can induce peculiar dispersion effects, far beyond mere compensation. Taking inspiration from the parity-time symmetry concept in quantum physics, we put forward and explore a class of non-Hermitian metasurfaces that may exhibit extreme anisotropy mainly induced by the gain-loss interplay. Through analytical modeling and full-wave numerical simulations, we illustrate the associated phenomenon of surface-wave canalization, explore nonlocal effects and possible departures from the ideal conditions, and address the feasibility of the required constitutive parameters.

To elucidate general trends in the behaviors of molecules, large amounts of data are required. Therefore, both an accurate and a rapid computational approach can significantly promote the theoretical design of molecules. In this work, we combined quantum chemistry and machine learning (ML) to study the first hyperpolarizability (β) in [2.2]paracyclophane-containing push-pull compounds with various terminal donor/acceptor pairs and molecular lengths. To generate reference β values for ML, the ab initio elongation finite-field method was used, allowing us to treat long polymer chains with linear scale efficiency and high computational accuracy. A neural network (NN) model was built for β prediction, and the relevant molecular descriptors were selected using a genetic algorithm. The established NN model accurately reproduced the β values (R2 &gt; 0.99) of long molecules based on the input quantum chemical properties (dipole moment, frontier molecular orbitals, etc.) of only the shortest systems and additional information about the actual system length. To obtain general trends in molecular descriptor-target property relationships learned by the NN, three approaches for explaining the ML decisions (i.e., partial dependence, accumulated local effects, and permutation feature importance) were used. The effect of donor/acceptor alternation on β in the studied systems was examined. The asymmetric extension of molecular regions end-capped with donors and acceptors produced unequal β responses. The results revealed how the electronic properties originating from the nature of substituents on the microscale controlled the magnitude of β according to the NN approximation. The applied approach facilitates the conceptual discoveries in chemistry by using ML to both (i) efficiently generate data and (ii) provide a source of information about causal correlations among system properties. © 2021 Author(s).",,10.1063/5.0040342,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103290051&doi=10.1063%2f5.0040342&partnerID=40&md5=24bac38433679ce242beeeadba1e7802,Article

An important paradigm within artificial intelligence is reinforcement learning1, where decision-making entities called agents interact with environments and learn by updating their behaviour on the basis of the obtained feedback. The crucial question for practical applications is how fast agents learn2. Although various studies have made use of quantum mechanics to speed up the agent’s decision-making process3,4, a reduction in learning time has not yet been demonstrated. Here we present a reinforcement learning experiment in which the learning process of an agent is sped up by using a quantum communication channel with the environment.

Here, we study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse Ising model with algebraic long-range exchange coupling. Using a state of the art tensor-network approach, complemented by analytic calculations and considering various observables, we show that a weak form of causality emerges, characterized by nonuniversal dynamical exponents. While the local spin and spin correlation causal edges are sub-ballistic, the causal region has a rich internal structure, which, depending on the observable, displays ballistic or superballistic features. In contrast, the causal region of entanglement entropy is featureless and its edge is always ballistic, irrespective of the interaction range.

At the same time, the high performance of quantum computers imposes serious risks for cybersecurity. We can expect an arms race between rival parties: a defensive side trying to ensure the privacy and dependability of stored and transmitted information and their adversaries. With this article, the authors aim to provide an overview of the status of quantum computer development, project the next steps, and investigate the impact future quantum systems may have on cybersecurity and military operations. We first discuss the basic aspects that differentiate quantum computing from classical computing and find that analogies between both domains are quite limited. The world of quantum computers is remarkably diverse already, and we elaborate that quantum simulators and universal quantum computers have “qubits” in com-mon but still work in fundamentally different ways. Since security experts focus on upcoming trends in quantum computing, we take a look at the latest technologies and at the race for first reaching “quantum supremacy.” Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the specific risks future quantum computers represent for established cryptosystems and conclude that asymmetric algorithms like the RSA protocol are particularly vulnerable. The dangers of quantum computing for cryptography are obvious, as is the high relevance of the safety of stored and transmitted data to the defense sector. However, we examine the capability spectrum of quantum technologies and discover that breaking asymmetric encryption algorithms is just one facet, and other features like Grover’s quantum algorithm may revolutionize the logistics of the armed forces. Satellite Quantum Key Distribution is another promising concept that may change the communication between military units.

(2021),2021,Charge-offset stability of single-electron devices based on single-layered Fe nanodot array,AIP Advances,"In metal-based single-electron devices (SEDs), charge-offset drift has been observed, which is a time-dependent instability caused by charge noise. This instability is an issue in the application of new information processing devices, such as neural network devices, quantum computing devices (charge sensing), and reservoir computing devices. Therefore, the charge-offset drift in metal-based SEDs needs to be suppressed. However, the charge-offset stability of metal-based SEDs has not been investigated in depth, except in the case of Al and Al2O3 SEDs. In this work, Fe-based SEDs formed by single-layer Fe nanodot arrays embedded in MgF2 were studied with regard to their charge-offset stability. Using devices that produce simple current oscillations, the charge-offset drift (ΔQ0) of Fe-based SEDs was evaluated by focusing on peak shifts of the simple current oscillation over time, despite the use of a multi-dot system. This drift (ΔQ0 ≈ 0.3e) was shown to be much lower than in SEDs with Al-dots and Al2O3 tunnel junctions. Notably, the charge-offset drift in the metal-based SEDs was suppressed using the Fe-MgF2 system. The excellent stability of these devices was attributed to the material properties of the Fe-MgF2 system. Finally, as the Fe nanodot array contained numerous dots, the effect of satellite dots acting as traps on the charge-offset instability was discussed. The findings of this study will be important in future applications of metal-based SEDs in new information processing devices. © 2021 Author(s).",,10.1063/5.0040241,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102600891&doi=10.1063%2f5.0040241&partnerID=40&md5=b4c9a2e0f7fb72680ff97eb25de88dc8,Article

It is of critical significance to realize high-fidelity quantum controlled gates on photon-spin hybrid systems. In this paper, based on the novel balance condition for the interaction between a single input photon and a singly charged QD embedded in an optical single-sided microcavity, we present three schemes for implementing three universal quantum controlled gates, i.e., the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, the three-qubit Toffoli gate, and the three-qubit Fredkin gate, on composite hybrid quantum systems consisting of flying photons and QD-confined electron spins. By exploiting the balance condition, the noise caused by the unbalanced reflectance of the coupled and uncoupled QD-cavity systems can be efficiently suppressed, so that the fidelity of each quantum gate operation can be raised to unity in principle. The balance condition can be met without the strict requirement of strong coupling, making the high-fidelity quantum gates easier to be demonstrated in experiments. These features can improve the fidelity and feasibility of these schemes, which can be applied to large-scaled quantum computing and quantum information networks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s10773-021-04738-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100952592&doi=10.1007%2fs10773-021-04738-8&partnerID=40&md5=dfb336f6b659a3fdad350587a05cf385,Article

Inducing macrophages to differentiate into M2 subtype can reduce immune inflammatory response and accelerate tissue repair after implantation. An interpenetration network hydrogel is developed utilizing graphene oxide (GO)-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)/poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), in which two bioactive molecules, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), are loaded and released in a controlled manner to induce macrophages to differentiate into M2 type and enhance bone formation. These two factors are initially loaded with GO and then embedded into the CMC/PEGDA hydrogel for sustained release. Results indicate that the hydrogel shows enhanced mechanical stiffness, strength, and stability. The hydrogel loaded with IL-4 and BMP-2 significantly promotes both macrophage M2-type differentiation and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies show that the implantation of this hydrogel markedly reduces local inflammation while enhancing bone regeneration at 8 weeks post-implantation. In all, the findings suggest that hydrogel loaded with IL-4 and BMP-2 has synergistic effects on bone regeneration.

This paper presents a novel QCA architecture employing majority gates in cross-coupled and cross-oriented structures in QCA designer platform. The selection of the structures in-turn depends on the minimum number of QCA cell usage. In the proposed methodology, an optimised Random Key Generator (RKG) has been constructed using QCA by employing a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) as a select input to the 2:1 MUX. The MUX generates a random key by selecting either Galois Ring Oscillators (GRO) or Fibonacci Ring Oscillators (FRO). Further, the proposed scheme reduces the Flip flop usage into EXOR gates and wire as compared to the conventional design. The clock circuitry used in the QCA platform would decide the initial seed to the FROs, GROs and the LFSR circuitry in QCA which makes the output Random Key Sequence truly unpredictable. The generated random numbers are used as a key to encode the pixels in the image which enhances the security. Further, the encoded image pixels are encrypted using Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) encryption algorithm to render confusion, permutation and diffusion by adopting various rule sets. Image encryption metrics like correlation, entropy, Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI) were computed.

When applied to large systems, the original version of the technique still relies on promolecular electron densities given by the sum of spherically averaged atomic electron distributions, which leads to approximate evaluations of the inter- and intramolecular interactions occurring in systems of biological interest. To overcome this drawback and perform IGM analyses based on quantum mechanically rigorous electron densities also for macromolecular systems, we coupled the IGM approach with the recently constructed libraries of extremely localized molecular orbitals (ELMOs) that allow fast and reliable reconstructions of polypeptide and protein electron densities. The validation tests performed on small polypeptides and peptide dimers have shown that the novel IGM-ELMO strategy provides results that are systematically closer to the fully quantum mechanical ones and outperforms the IGM method based on the crude promolecular approximation, but still keeping a quite low computational cost. The results of the test calculations carried out on proteins have also confirmed the trends observed for the IGM analyses conducted on small systems.

(2021),2021,Room-Temperature Coupling of Single Photon Emitting Quantum Dots to Localized and Delocalized Modes in a Plasmonic Nanocavity Array,ACS Photonics,"Single photon sources, especially those based on solid state quantum emitters, are key elements in future quantum technologies. What is required is the development of broadband, high quantum efficiency, room temperature, single photon sources, which can also be tunably coupled to optical cavities, which could lead to the development of all-optical quantum communication platforms. In this regard, the deterministic coupling of single photon sources to plasmonic nanocavity arrays has a great advantage due to a long propagation length and delocalized nature of surface lattice resonances. Guided by these considerations, we report experiments on the room temperature tunable coupling of single photon emitting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) to localized surface plasmon and surface lattice resonance modes in plasmonic nanocavity arrays. Using a time-resolved photoluminescence measurement on isolated CQD, we report the significant advantage of surface lattice resonances in realizing a much higher Purcell effect, despite the large dephasing of CQDs, with values of ∼22 and ∼6 for coupling to the lattice and localized modes, respectively. We present measurements on the antibunching of CQDs coupled to these modes with g(2)(0) values in the quantum domain, providing evidence for effective cooperative behavior. We present a density matrix treatment of the coupling of CQDs to plasmonic and lattice modes enabling us to model the experimental results on Purcell factors as well as on the antibunching. We also provide experimental evidence of indirect excitation of remote CQDs mediated by the lattice modes and propose a model to explain these observations. Our study demonstrates the possibility of developing nanophotonic platforms for single photon operations and communications with broadband quantum emitters and plasmonic nanocavity arrays since these arrays can generate entanglement between spatially separated quantum emitters. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acsphotonics.0c01635,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100955126&doi=10.1021%2facsphotonics.0c01635&partnerID=40&md5=56f231562883addf6044b71c46d5b888,Article

(2021),2021,Highly permeable thin film composite hollow fiber membranes for brackish water desalination by incorporating amino functionalized carbon quantum dots and hypochlorite treatment,Journal of Membrane Science,"A novel strategy has been demonstrated to synergistically improve the separation performance of thin film composite (TFC) hollow fiber membranes for brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination. It consists of two steps. Firstly, a series of amino functionalized carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized and incorporated into the polyamide layer of TFC membranes. The modified TFC membrane with the optimal amino functionalized CQDs has a pure water permeability (PWP) of 5.50 LMH/bar and a NaCl rejection of 98.0% against a 2000 ppm NaCl feed solution at 15 bar. Comparing with the unmodified TFC membrane, the modified TFC membrane has a 42.1% higher PWP without compromising the salt rejection. Then the modified TFC membrane was treated by a sodium hypochlorite solution at different concentrations. Chlorine was bonded to the polyamide layers, enhancing their repulsion against charged solutes and making the polyamide network less cross-linked. As a result, both PWP and NaCl rejection of the TFC membranes could be improved. After being treated with a sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution at 4000 ppm for 3h, the aforementioned modified TFC membrane displays a PWP of 10.13 LMH/bar and a NaCl rejection of 98.9% against a 2000 ppm NaCl solution at 15 bar, which demonstrates a great potential for brackish water desalination. This study may mark a milestone for the development of future BWRO membranes based on the use of amino functionalized CQDs and hypochlorite treatment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118952,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097769854&doi=10.1016%2fj.memsci.2020.118952&partnerID=40&md5=608ee5b41f29b9adaadd2d88e071e184,Article

The theoretical results support one group of existing experiments over the other.

564,Scopus,Fujii et al. (2021),2021,Development of an epitaxial growth technique using iii-v on a si platform for heterogeneous integration of membrane photonic devices on si,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"The rapid increase in total transmission capacity within and between data centers requires the construction of low-cost, high-capacity optical transmitters. Since a tremendous number of transmitters are required, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) using Si photonics technology enabling the integration of various functional devices on a single chip is a promising solution. A limitation of a Si-based PIC is the lack of an efficient light source due to the indirect bandgap of Si; therefore, hybrid integration technology of III-V semiconductor lasers on Si is desirable. The major challenges are that heterogeneous integration of III-V materials on Si induces the formation of dislocation at high process temperature; thus, the epitaxial regrowth process is difficult to apply. This paper reviews the evaluations conducted on our epitaxial growth technique using a directly bonded III-V membrane layer on a Si substrate. This technique enables epitaxial growth without the fundamental difficulties associated with lattice mismatch or anti-phase boundaries. In addition, crystal degradation correlating with the difference in thermal expansion is eliminated by keeping the total III-V layer thickness thinner than ~350 nm. As a result, various III-V photonic-device-fabrication technologies, such as buried regrowth, butt-joint regrowth, and selective area growth, can be applicable on the Si-photonics platform. We demonstrated the growth of indium-gallium-aluminum arsenide (In-GaAlAs) multi-quantum wells (MQWs) and fabrication of lasers that exhibit >25 Gbit/s direct modulation with low energy cost. In addition, selective-area growth that enables the full O-band bandgap control of the MQW layer over the 150-nm range was demonstrated. We also fabricated indium-gallium-arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP) based phase modulators integrated with a distributed feedback laser. Therefore, the directly bonded III-V-on-Si substrate platform paves the way to manufacturing hybrid PICs for future data-center networks. © 2021 by the authors.

(2021),2021,Quantum Semantic Learning by Reverse Annealing of an Adiabatic Quantum Computer,Advanced Quantum Technologies,"Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) constitute a class of neural networks for unsupervised learning with applications ranging from pattern classification to quantum state reconstruction. Despite the potential representative power, the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited since their training process proves to be hard. The advent of commercial adiabatic quantum computers (AQCs) raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices can increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. Here, the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs is demonstrated, thanks to an embedding that associates the nodes of the neural networks to virtual qubits. A semantic quantum search is implemented thanks to a reverse annealing schedule. Such an approach exploits more information from the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling algorithm. The semantic training is shown to quickly raise the sampling probability of a subset of the set of the configurations. Even without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule, the RBM semantically trained achieves good scores on reconstruction tasks. The development of such techniques paves the way toward the establishment of a quantum advantage of adiabatic quantum computers, especially given the foreseen improvement of such hardware. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH",,10.1002/qute.202000133,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106080859&doi=10.1002%2fqute.202000133&partnerID=40&md5=427a7ae2d71edd40634a62c05ae0f142,Article

To circumvent this problem, we propose a noise-reduction scheme using wave-front shaping. It is demonstrated that the average output quantum noise can be effectively suppressed even beyond the shot-noise limit. Both the decrease of amplification strength and the increase of input squeezing strength can give rise to a decrease in the suppressed average quantum noise.

Photonics-assisted technologies show many advantages in generating signals of ultrabroad bandwidth at high carrier frequencies in the millimeter-wave, terahertz, and IR bands. Among these frequency options, the mid-IR band has recently attracted great interest for future wireless communication due to its intrinsic merits of low propagation loss and high tolerance of atmospheric perturbations.

Effects of incorporation of a buffer layer (n-type), in between substrate and low doped active region of the hexagonal (4H and 6H) pin (p++-p+-n−-n-n++) vertical mesa structure is thoroughly studied in this paper for the improvement of MM-wave performance of the single device. Also, a thin layer of Ge has been introduced in between Si substrate and n+ cubic-SiC layer in 3C-SiC pin-device for minimising the lattice mismatch issue in between Si/3C-SiC interface. The comprehensive analysis establish that the forward characteristics, reverse recovery time (1 ns) and breakdown voltage (171 Volt) in case of 4H-SiC device are quite good in comparison to its cubic (3C) and other hexagonal (6H) counterparts, however, the switching characteristics of 3C-SiC pin diode array is comparatively better than its hexagonal counterparts. This observation could be explained in terms of lowest series resistance in 3C-SiC based single pin device that has been achieved by incorporating Ge layer in mesa structure. The authors have made a comparative analysis among SPST, SPDT and SPMT pin switches made up with 4H, 6H and 3C-SiC poly-types. At 94 GHz, W-band central frequency, series resistance in 4H-SiC single device is 0.59 Ω, whereas, the same is much lower (0.27 Ω) in case of 3C-SiC. Insertion loss and isolation in 3C-SiC pin array of switches are found to be 0.18 dB and 38 dB (SPST switch), 0.19 dB and 67 dB (SPDT switch), 0.20 dB and 90 dB (SPMT shunt type switching array) and 0.23 dB and 74 dB (SPMT series-shunt type switching array). This newly proposed QDD model validation is done through comparative studies between experiment and analytical results for 4H-SiC SPST switches in low-frequency Microwave region. The validated QDD model, coupled with PSpice and Comsol Multi-physics simulator, then used for designing of the W-band devices and corresponding switches. However, as far as author’s knowledge is concerned, no experiment is yet done with SiC pin diodes at W-band frequencies, in literature for comparison. From simulation point of view also such an extensive study on hexagonal and cubic SiC pin diode switches at W-band region has not yet been done by any other researcher group. This paper, for the first time, establishes the feasibility and potentiality of IV-IV group semiconductor based pin (p++-p+-n−-n-n++) switches for W-band applications. Comparative analysis also reveals that 3C-SiC based shunt type pin (p++-p+-n−-n-n++) SPMT switches are the best for MMW-communication systems. Thermal modelling of the designed devices are also compared and reported in this paper. The quasi-3D thermal analysis is done to optimize the mesa and heat-sink diameter/dimensions so as to minimize the thermal runaway issues.

The simulator has incorporated several important physical phenomena that arise in superlattice structure, including quantum confinement effects, generation-recombination and tunnelling generation of carriers as well as scattering limited carrier mobility and velocity in GaN/AlGaN structure. In order to reduce the dislocation density and in turn the series resistance in GaN/AlGaN heterostructure, thin AlN nucleation layer and a buffer layer are considered in the simulation. It is observed that the RF series resistance of the pin device, operating around 0.2 THz frequency regime, reduces in case of proposed superlattice structure. The advantages of super-lattice pin diode over the conventional Si devices are the faster reverse recovery time (~ 9 vs 35 ns) and lowering of forward RF series resistances (0.39 vs 1.20 Ω). This study also reveals that SPST and SPMT switches made up with super-lattice devices are characterized by low insertion loss (~ 0.13 and 0.15 dB, respectively) and high isolation (~ 65.4 and 82.5 dB, respectively). A good agreement between theory and experiment establishes the superiority of the present model over the others.

In addition to this, a detailed thermal modelling of the device has also been done to make the analysis more realistic. The junction temperature of the designed GaN/AlGaN superlattice pin switch will be as high as 377 K, which is quite moderate compared to its flat profile counterpart.

579,Scopus,Kroonblawd et al. (2021),2021,A Quantum-Based Approach to Predict Primary Radiation Damage in Polymeric Networks,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,"Initial atomistic-level radiation damage in chemically reactive materials is thought to induce reaction cascades that can result in undesirable degradation of macroscale properties. Ensembles of quantum-based molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations can accurately predict these cascades, but extracting chemical insights from the many underlying trajectories is a labor-intensive process that can require substantial a priori intuition. We develop here a general and automated graph-based approach to extract all chemically distinct structures sampled in QMD simulations and apply our approach to predict primary radiation damage of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the main constituent of silicones. A postprocessing protocol is developed to identify underlying polymer backbone structures as connected components in QMD trajectories. These backbones form a repository of radiation-damaged structures. A scheme for extracting and updating a library of isomorphically distinct structures is proposed to identify the spanning set and aid chemical interpretation of the repository. The analyses are applied to ensembles of cascade QMD simulations in which the four element types in PDMS are selectively excited in primary knock-on atom events. Our approach reveals a much higher degree of combinatorial complexity in this system than was inferred through radiolysis experiments. Probabilities are extracted for radiation-induced network changes including formation of branch points, carbon linkages, cycles, bond scissions, and carbon uptake into the Si-O siloxane backbone network. The general analysis framework presented here is readily extendable to modeling chemical degradation of other polymers and molecular materials and provides a basis for future quantum-informed multiscale modeling of radiation damage. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00967,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097749342&doi=10.1021%2facs.jctc.0c00967&partnerID=40&md5=fbeb3feb0727206a7987feb1f4ab20c9,Article
580,Scopus,Borišek et al. (2021),2021,Atomic-Level Mechanism of Pre-mRNA Splicing in Health and Disease,Accounts of Chemical Research,"ConspectusIntron removal from premature-mRNA (pre-mRNA splicing) is an essential part of gene expression and regulation that is required for the production of mature, protein-coding mRNA. The spliceosome (SPL), a majestic machine composed of five small nuclear RNAs and hundreds of proteins, behaves as an eminent transcriptome tailor, efficiently performing splicing as a protein-directed metallo-ribozyme. To select and excise long and diverse intronic sequences with single-nucleotide precision, the SPL undergoes a continuous compositional and conformational remodeling, forming eight distinct complexes throughout each splicing cycle. Splicing fidelity is of paramount importance to preserve the integrity of the proteome. Mutations in splicing factors can severely compromise the accuracy of this machinery, leading to aberrant splicing and altered gene expression. Decades of biochemical and genetic studies have provided insights into the SPL's composition and function, but its complexity and plasticity have prevented an in-depth mechanistic understanding. Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy techniques have ushered in a new era for comprehending eukaryotic gene regulation, providing several near-atomic resolution structures of the SPL from yeast and humans. Nevertheless, these structures represent isolated snapshots of the splicing process and are insufficient to exhaustively assess the function of each SPL component and to unravel particular facets of the splicing mechanism in a dynamic environment.In this Account, building upon our contributions in this field, we discuss the role of biomolecular simulations in uncovering the mechanistic intricacies of eukaryotic splicing in health and disease. Specifically, we showcase previous applications to illustrate the role of atomic-level simulations in elucidating the function of specific proteins involved in the architectural reorganization of the SPL along the splicing cycle. Moreover, molecular dynamics applications have uniquely contributed to decrypting the channels of communication required for critical functional transitions of the SPL assemblies. They have also shed light on the role of carcinogenic mutations in the faithful selection of key intronic regions and the molecular mechanism of splicing modulators. Additionally, we emphasize the role of quantum-classical molecular dynamics in unraveling the chemical details of pre-mRNA cleavage in the SPL and in its evolutionary ancestors, group II intron ribozymes. We discuss methodological pitfalls of multiscale calculations currently used to dissect the splicing mechanism, presenting future challenges in this field. The results highlight how atomic-level simulations can enrich the interpretation of experimental results. We envision that the synergy between computational and experimental approaches will aid in developing innovative therapeutic strategies and revolutionary gene modulation tools to fight the over 200 human diseases associated with splicing misregulation, including cancer and neurodegeneration. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00578,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098857730&doi=10.1021%2facs.accounts.0c00578&partnerID=40&md5=f9ac0cd509a0e478dc4ef3cb598deb79,Article
581,Scopus,Shirakawa et al. (2021),2021,Discretized quantum adiabatic process for free fermions and comparison with the imaginary-time evolution,Physical Review Research,"Motivated by recent progress of quantum technologies making small-scale programmable quantum computing possible, here we study a discretized quantum adiabatic process for a one-dimensional free-fermion system described by a variational wave function, i.e., a parametrized quantum circuit. The wave function is composed of M layers of two elementary sets of time-evolution operators, each set being decomposed into commutable local operators acting on neighboring sites. The evolution time of each time-evolution operator is treated as a variational parameter so as to minimize the expectation value of the energy. We show that the exact ground state is reached by applying the layers of time-evolution operators as many as a quarter of the system size, implying that at least in this case, the state is exactly prepared in a quantum circuit with linear depth. This is the minimum number MB of layers set by the limit of speed, i.e., the Lieb-Robinson bound, for propagating quantum entanglement via the local time-evolution operators. Indeed, we show the mutual information of the variational wave function that reveals a causality-cone-like structure in the propagation of quantum entanglement. Quantities such as the energy E and the entanglement entropy S of the optimized variational wave function with the number M of layers less than MB are independent of the system size L but fall into some universal functions of M, indicating that the entanglement generated in this variational ansatz with a finite M is bounded, as in the case of the matrix product states with a finite bond dimension. Furthermore, in this case, we find that these two quantities behave asymptotically as E/L- ∞∼M-2 (∞: the exact ground-state energy per site in the thermodynamic limit) and S≈13lnM. The development of the entanglement in the variational ansatz through the discretized quantum adiabatic process is further manifested in the progressive propagation of single-particle orbitals in the variational wave function. We also find that the optimized variational parameters converge systematically to a smooth function of the discretized time, which provides the optimum scheduling function in the quantum adiabatic process, with the effective total evolution time of the variational ansatz to the exact ground state being proportional to the system size L. This is a drastic improvement compared to the evolution time proportional to L2 for the continuous-time quantum adiabatic process with a linear scheduling and is attributed to diabaticity of the discretized quantum adiabatic process represented in the variational ansatz. Finally, we investigate the imaginary-time evolution counterpart of this variational wave function, where the causality relation is absent due to the nonunitarity of the imaginary-time evolution operators, and thus the norm of the wave function is no longer conserved. We find that the convergence to the exact ground state is exponentially fast, despite that the system is at the critical point, suggesting that implementation of the nonunitary imaginary-time evolution in a quantum circuit is highly promising to further shallow the circuit depth, provided that the local nonunitary operators are represented with a reasonable amount of unitary operators. © 2021 authors.

Thus, it is quite beneficial to further improve the system performance with the vortex electromagnetic waves in THz band.

The plane radiation distribution and channel characteristics of vortex electromagnetic waves at 0.22-THz are studied. The simulation results show that the THz vortex waves present obvious quantum state compared with lower frequency electromagnetic waves. The transmission distance, the radius of antenna array and the number of antenna elements could affect the characteristics of THz-OAM channel.

However the ambitious HL-LHC program will require much more computing resources in the next two decades. Quantum computing may offer speed-up for HEP physics analyses at HL-LHC, and can be a new computational paradigm for big data analyses in High Energy Physics. We have successfully employed three methods (1) Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) method, (2) Quantum Support Vector Machine Kernel (QSVM-kernel) method and (3) Quantum Neural Network (QNN) method for two LHC flagship analyses: ttH (Higgs production in association with two top quarks) and H->mumu (Higgs decay to two muons, the second generation fermions).

The work is in the context of a Qubit platform (a gate-model quantum computer). Taking into account the present limitation of hardware access, different quantum machine learning methods are studied on simulators and the results are compared with classical machine learning methods (BDT, classical Support Vector Machine and classical Neural Network). Furthermore, we do apply quantum machine learning on IBM quantum hardware to compare performance between quantum simulator and quantum hardware.

Much work in this respect is currently being conducted, making it hard to keep track of the many individual challenges and respective solutions so far identified. In consequence, it is difficult to judge, whether all (known) challenges have been sufficiently addressed, and whether suitable solutions have been provided. We present results of a literature survey and discuss discovered challenges and solutions categorized into different areas and utilize our findings to evaluate the state of readiness for a full scale PQC migration. We use our findings as starting point to initiate an open community project in the form of a website3 to keep track of the ongoing efforts and the state of the art in PQC research. Thereby, we offer a single entry-point for the community into the subject reflecting the current state in a timely manner. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

595,Scopus,McNeil et al. (2021),2021,From complex to complicated: development of a Model Based Systems Engineering and cyber security approach for a quantum key distribution nanosatellite.,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","Current global security systems are built on the premise that mathematical complexity and limitations of processing power are sufficient to protect data. With the emergence of quantum computing these assumptions are now being challenged. Space based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of encryption key delivery offering significant benefits over ground-based counterparts in terms of range and coverage. Additionally, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers increases in efficiency through cloud avoidance. For an AI enabled nanosatellite for QKD, design engineers must trade the often-conflicting requirements of space, cybersecurity, AI and quantum to progress the design from the complex to the merely complicated. The Responsive Operations for Key Services (ROKS) mission aims to provide QKD services which augment larger scale QKD efforts. The onboarding of AI to detect and avoid cloud has a significant impact on the concept of operations, moving to significant levels of autonomy. In systems engineering terms, added to the design burden of implementing an emerging technology such as QKD, the established principles of operation are also being challenged. Additionally, as nanosatellites have rarely been deployed as nodes in a secure network to date, the project requires the synthesising of different security standards and approaches into a coherent framework. For the programme significant consideration is given to project lifecycle. In the initial phases agile principles are employed, allowing for experimentation in design. With increasing knowledge of the problem space, there is a reduction in the uncertainty in design elements, leading to a transition from an agile based lifecycle to the waterfall-based methods more suitable for Flight Model implementation. Underpinning the project is a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. Enterprise Architect was selected as the MBSE tool of choice during blue sky design stages, allowing a smooth transition from capability level considerations to systems and subsystems design. The Zachman framework offers a consistent, but potentially over flexible, approach to model development. MBSE offers a clear methodology for integrating the model with external simulation tools to provide on ground verification of platform behaviours and porting design effort to support new mission concepts. The application of flexibility in lifecycle management, sound security principles and a model-based approach to technical development has proven to be a highly effective approach in increasing our understanding of complex systems allowing for complicated, but mature, designs to be defined. © 2021 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

There-fore, it is of great importance to detect electricity theft from both an economic and social perspective. With the help of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids, now it is possible to detect theft activities through analyzing the recorded electricity consuming data using advanced techniques, such as machine learning. However, training a learning model, especially for the ones with a huge amount of parameters, is always resource-consuming, and users could encounter performance bottlenecks due to hardware limitations. To improve the problem, using quantum computing for machine learning tasks has shown to be an effective approach to speed up the learning process. However, the relevant techniques have not been studied in the domain of energy yet. As a pioneering exploration, in this work, we are trying to leverage a quantum classification algorithm to classify the electricity dataset and on that basis to perform a case study on theft activity detection. Specifically, we have given the details of our design in the study, and our experimental results show that the prediction accuracy can be significantly improved with increasing training epochs, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum machine learning for energy data analysis. © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData-Cybermatics53846.2021.00043,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127419577&doi=10.1109%2fiThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData-Cybermatics53846.2021.00043&partnerID=40&md5=1aaf17dc36775062d48210f5ad54e281,Conference Paper

(2021),2021,UNIVERSAL POSITIONING SYSTEM- THE FUTURE OF SPACE NAVIGATION,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","Due to the magnitude of launches in the recent times, there is a significant rise in space debris. With constant improvement in space technology, an increase in the magnitude of space missions is expected. All of these factors lead to more space-borne traffic. This needs to be regulated to ensure safe space travel. This paper proposes a novel methodology for navigation and communication, the Universal Positioning System (UPS). The proposed UPS aims to provide solutions to issues in navigation during situations such as space-emergency docking, mid-way fuelling, and trajectory diversion. The technology also aims to be used as a rescue tool for Extravehicular Activity (EVA) during emergencies. UPS uses Application Programming Interface (API) which intends safe navigation through the vastness of the space. Safe travel will be enabled by concurrent charting of the data from the pre-proposed trajectory of the journey, Deep Space Network (DSN), Space Traffic Control (STC), and Artificial Intelligence-powered debris tracking. The proposed DSN allows the space vehicles to precisely target distant bodies and sites of interest on them. STC will be a service provided by the space traffic controllers who will monitor and direct the spacecraft according to the planned objective and provide advisory services in miscellaneous situations. UPS aims to use Space-based Quantum Communication to ensure data safety. All the elements will be integrated with the API along with the location sensors in every mission-commissioned space-element along with proposed intermediate interplanetary quantum data centers for quick-fetch of the location coordinates. The operations such as docking can be automated and simplified by the fly-by approach, following the communication protocols suggested by UPS. The proposed optimum architecture aims to make the system cheaper, easy, and reliable. The vision of UPS is to make space travel safer and faster in the longer run.

While symmetric algorithms can adapt to those challenges, no prevalent key exchange method can protect against quantum computer based attacks. There already exist several new, quantum-resistant approaches. Yet, all of them either lack in confidence regarding their security or require large data to be transmitted. Due to the lack of confidence in these algorithms, researchers tend towards hybrid key exchange methods which combine at least two different algorithms. As long as one of them prevails, the shared secret remains secure. Yet, these hybrid key exchanges together with algorithms which transmit large payloads require significant changes to the design of security protocols. IKEv2 is willing to introduce radical changes in order to support as many different algorithms as possible. This was expected to impact the protocol's operational feasibility, but remained to be tested due to the lack of a working reference implementation of the newly proposed internet drafts. To address this issue, we implemented these drafts using a modified version of the OpenIKED as basis that already comprised the first steps towards the concept's integration. During the implementation we found that several design choices severely hinder a clean and maintainable structure. With the resulting implementation, we tested the adjusted protocol under real-world conditions. The results show that the result generally works but struggles to cope with slow, lossy networks. Based on these insights, we drafted an improved protocol design which also supports the full range of quantum-resistant key exchange methods. In contrast to the current drafts, it promises a cheaper and more maintainable implementation. © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/SIN54109.2021.9699255,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127289153&doi=10.1109%2fSIN54109.2021.9699255&partnerID=40&md5=502f92864e9f48f9d19df81268bc00fd,Conference Paper

There are quantum neurons that can carry an exponential amount of information to a linear number of quantum information units (qubits) using the quantum property of superposition. In this paper, we compare the performance of three of these quantum neuron models applied to the diabetes classification problem. We also propose the use of different data preprocessing strategies. Quantum neurons were simulated using the IBM Qiskit tool. We compare the preprocessing approaches applied to two toy problems (1) simulating the XOR operator and (2) solving a generic nonlinear problem. The results of the experiments shows that a single quantum neuron is capable of achieving an accuracy rate of 100% in the XOR problem and an accuracy rate of 100% in a non-linear dataset, demonstrating that the quantum neurons with real weights are capable of modeling non-linearly separable problems. In the problem of diagnosing diabetes, quantum neurons achieved an accuracy rate of 76% and AUC-ROC of 88%, while its classic version, the perceptron, reached only 63% accuracy and the artificial neural network reached 80% AUC-ROC.

This need is more pressing as unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) are applied in new areas and innovations such as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) swarms are developed. Millimeter-wave helps to meet the throughput demand as it provides the higher bandwidth that is needed for 5G wireless communication and beyond. But these higher frequencies also come with their own challenges, such as low signal penetration depth. The main challenge in modern wireless networks is to be able to accurately predict the dynamically changing radio environment. With the introduction of narrow beams in the mm-wave frequency, tracking of the beams is a great challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) could be employed to resolve this problem of beam tracking. In this talk, the challenges in mm-wave wireless networks for vehicle-to-vehicle communication will be highlighted and the ideas involving recent developments in phased-array antenna, beam-steering, beam-alignment, and tracking will be discussed. We shall then critically evaluate the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) within the network architecture to provide the required capability for tasks such as beam-control, data-feed processing, resource, and interference management. The next-generation wireless networks need to be self-predictive and proactive to handle futuristic applications like holographic communication, haptic feedback, or any latency-dependent application. Especially in the context of rapidly changing environment where the UAVs are moving fast, AI and/or QC would play a crucial role to achieve a dynamically adaptive network. Next-generation wireless networks offer more capacity for the conveyance of relevant information from onboard instruments such as cameras or thermal sensors. Thus, there shall be a need for the efficient processing of potentially copious amounts of raw data for relevant information. For example, to deploy a drone swarm in a search and rescue operation, the use of QC or AI could improve the processing of received visual information with respect to processing speed.

It is a multidis-ciplinary experienced system particularly designed to protect regions and people from cyber-terrorist and oppose unauthorized drones. Security and surveillance are two of the leading areas in the growing drone sector. Moreover, machine learning or deep learning could help in object detection because of its high accuracy and acceptable delay performance. Hence, this paper proposed a modified streaming protocol for drone surveillance with post-quantum cryptography that ensures the drone's data confidentiality. This paper also provided a deep learning receiver to perform object detection by using YOLOv2-Tiny, YOLOv3-Tiny, and YOLOv4-Tiny respectively. The 72 experiment results showed that all configurations on the 30-FPS input produced big overhead and huge delay. This leaves the option to set the FPS input to be lower than 30, yet the FPS benchmark result showed that even with the highest FPS configuration, the results were capped at a maximum of 14-FPS. Nevertheless, the results of the proposed methods confirmed the feasibility of using the developed surveillance drone on low-energy architecture. © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/IC2IE53219.2021.9649188,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124273856&doi=10.1109%2fIC2IE53219.2021.9649188&partnerID=40&md5=c3ad62be95685bf12a11d9b2ef70ac75,Conference Paper
613,Scopus,Oliver et al. (2021),2021,Vector Magnetic Current Imaging of an 8 nm Process Node Chip and 3D Current Distributions Using the Quantum Diamond Microscope,Conference Proceedings from the International Symposium for Testing and Failure Analysis,"The increasing trend for industry adoption of three-dimensional (3D) microelectronics packaging necessitates the development of new and innovative approaches to failure analysis. To that end, our team is developing a tool called the quantum diamond microscope (QDM) that leverages an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous wide field-of-view, high spatial resolution, vector magnetic field imaging of microelectronics under ambient conditions [1,2]. Here, we present QDM measurements of two-dimensional (2D) current distributions in an 8 nm process node flip chip integrated circuit (IC) and 3D current distributions in a custom, multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB). Magnetic field emanations from the C4 bumps in the flip chip dominate the QDM measurements, but these prove to be useful for image registration and can be subtracted to resolve adjacent current traces on the micron scale in the die. Vias, an important component in 3D ICs, display only Bx and By magnetic fields due to their vertical orientation, which are challenging to detect with magnetometers that traditionally only measure the Bz component of the magnetic field (orthogonal to the IC surface). Using the multi-layer PCB, we demonstrate that the QDM’s ability to simultaneously measure Bx, By, and Bz magnetic field components in 3D structures is advantageous for resolving magnetic fields from vias as current passes between layers. The height difference between two conducting layers is determined by the magnetic field images and agrees with the PCB design specifications. In our initial steps to provide further z depth information for current sources in complex 3D circuits using the QDM, we demonstrate that, due to the linear properties of Maxwell’s equations, magnetic field images of individual layers can be subtracted from the magnetic field image of the total structure. This allows for isolation of signal from individual layers in the device that can be used to map embedded current paths via solution of the 2D magnetic inverse. Such an approach suggests an iterative analysis protocol that utilizes neural networks trained with images containing various classes of current sources, standoff distances, and noise integrated with prior information of ICs to subtract current sources layer by layer and provide z depth information. This initial study demonstrates the usefulness of the QDM for failure analysis and points to technical advances of this technique to come.

One of the notable examples is the introduction of IoT-based smart home services (SHS), which aims to provide ubiquitous sensing and intelligent control at home. Security is an important issue in SHS that needs to be resolved before it can receive wide adoption. In this paper, we propose BC-SHS, a consortium blockchain to protect the IoT-based SHS. The SHS within a community forms a consortium blockchain, while the cloud service provider (CSP) joins the consortium blockchain to provide services through smart contracts. External communication (between smart homes and cloud servers) goes through this consortium blockchain, which ensures integrity, authenticity, auditability and privacy preservation of SHSs. In addition to this, we analyse state of the art post-quantum signature schemes and propose to adopt pqNTRUsign as a replacement to the existing ECDSA signature scheme. This can help to protect the proposed BC-SHS from potential quantum computer attack in future. We provide analysis on the proposed BC-SHS in terms of security, deployment cost and communication overhead.

The ongoing research in Quantum Dot Solar Cells (QDSC), Perovskites and Carbon nanotubes leads to the advancement in natural energy. The QDSCs are a fairly interesting concept that aims to increase the efficiencies and costs of the solar cell. In this paper, the construction and working of a Tandem Solar Cell is analysed and the different design parameters are calculated. The cell is a monolithic hybrid integrated structure consisting of a low bandgap Colloidal Quantum Dot (CQD) back cell on top of an Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) cell. The hybrid tandem solar cell is simulated using MATLAB software and the various parameters are calculated using various experimentations. Further, a Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm is used to train the experimented parameters for hybrid tandem solar cells. The training algorithm has been successfully used to accurately predict values for short circuit current density using three input parameters namely the open-circuit voltage and the thicknesses of the OPV and CQD, respectively.

These trends lead to increased needs of safe automatic or semi-automatic data interpretation, considered an open research question for many critical high value industrial products such as within the aerospace industry. By safe, we mean that the interpretation is not allowed to unawarely or unexpectedly fail; specifically the algorithms must react sensibly to inputs dissimilar to the training data, so called out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In this work we explore data interpretation with deep neural networks to address: robust safe data interpretation which includes a confidence estimate with respect to OOD data, an OOD detector; generation of realistic synthetic material aw indications for the material science and nondestructive evaluation community. We have focused on industrial XCT related challenges, addressing difficulties with spatially correlated X-ray quantum noise. Results are reported on training auto-encoders (AE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), on a publicly available XCT dataset of additively manufactured metal. We demonstrate that adding modeled X-ray noise during training reduces artefacts in the generated imperfection indications as well as improves the OOD detector performance.

Our initial qGAN prototype focuses on a one-dimensional toy-distribution, representing the energy deposited in a detector by a single particle. It employs three qubits and achieves high physics accuracy thanks to hyper-parameter optimisation. Furthermore, we study the influence of real hardware noise for the qML GAN training.

However, GANs are computationally expensive, sometimes computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, training GANs may suffer from convergence failure and modal collapse. Aiming at the acceleration of use cases for practical quantum computers, we propose QuGAN, a quantum GAN architecture that provides stable convergence, quantum-states based gradients and significantly reduced parameter sets. The QuGAN architecture runs both the discriminator and the generator purely on quantum state fidelity and utilizes the swap test on qubits to calculate the values of quantum-based loss functions. Built on quantum layers, QuGAN achieves similar performance with a 94.98% reduction on the parameter set when compared to classical GANs. With the same number of parameters, additionally, QuGAN outperforms state-of-the-art quantum based GANs in the literature providing a 48.33% improvement in system performance compared to others attaining less than 0.5% in terms of similarity between generated distributions and original data sets.

631,Scopus,Zhang et al. (2021),2021,Design and simulation of electromagnetically induced transparent structure based on terahertz metamaterials,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"A three-dimensional structure device that realizes electromagnetic-induced transparency (EIT) in the terahertz band is designed. We use metamaterials to simulate electromagnetic-induced transparency phenomena, through the design of effective metamaterial unit structures, acquire high transmittance while achieving strong dispersion, reducing the absorption of light waves by the medium in the slow light process. EIT's frequency response is expressed as a narrowband transparent window formed in a large block peak. There are two coupling methods for metamaterials to achieve EIT: bright-bright mode coupling and bright-dark mode coupling. Obviously, the structures in the bright-mode coupled metamaterial unit can be directly excited by incident waves to form a resonant mode, that is, there are at least two radiating mode resonators, which are generally two-dimensional planar structures such as double strips, double rings, etc. This work breaks through the traditional planar patch structure, connects the two resonant rings with cylinders, and innovatively constructs a three-dimensional metamaterial unit. We successfully achieve EIT in the range of 1.06THz to 1.41THz, at a resonance frequency of 1.26THz, the two narrow-band resonance peaks of EIT are located at 1.22THz and 1.30 THz. Realizing EIT through terahertz metamaterials, thereby realizing slow light effect, have paved the way for the design of slow-light devices to meet the future demand for ultra-fast optical signal processing and promote the development of next-generation communication technologies. © 2021 COPYRIGHT SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2606122,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121572615&doi=10.1117%2f12.2606122&partnerID=40&md5=723f74c93b9c31892ef42d741c4e7412,Conference Paper

(2021),2021,Preliminary characterisation of titanium nitride thin film at 300 mK for the development of kinetic inductance travelling wave parametric amplifiers,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Travelling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) made from highly nonlinear reactive superconducting thin films have been demonstrated to be a viable technology for various quantum applications, including fundamental physics experiments such as astronomy and axion dark matter searches, as well as commercial applications like quantum computational and communication systems. In this paper, we present the design of a kinetic inductance TWPA comprising a patterned titanium nitride film that can operate at 0.3K to demonstrate the feasibility of operation closer to 1K temperature, paving the way to achieve even higher bath temperature operation. We discuss in detail the design of our TWPA, along with the predicted gain-bandwidth product and other characteristics. We perform the preliminary experimental investigation of the thin film properties and compare that with the simulated results. We found that there are several discrepancies between the measured and the predicted behaviour of the thin film. We attribute these differences to the fact that the fabricated thin film has a different gap voltage, resistivity and thickness to what we expected. With a new set of estimated parameters, we successfully reproduce the measured transmission profile. We further show that by utilising bridges to ensure equipotential grounds for the CPW lines, we are able to reduce the rippling effect and achieve a higher gain with broader bandwidth. We expect that our TWPA can achieve higher than 20 dB gain from approximately 0-8 GHz. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This has attracted research interest from academia and the industry in the application of industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in the O&#x0026;G sector. The application of some of these I4.0 technologies has been presented in the literature, but the domain still lacks a comprehensive survey of the application of I4.0 in the O&#x0026;G upstream sector. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art efforts directed toward I4.0 technologies in the O&#x0026;G upstream sector. To achieve this, first, an overview of the I4.0 is discussed followed by a systematic literature review from an integrative perspective for publications between 2012-2021 with 223 analyzed documents. The benefits and challenges of the adoption of I4.0 have been identified. Moreover, the paper adds value by proposing a framework for the implementation of I4.0 in the O&#x0026;G upstream sector. Finally, future directions and research opportunities such as framework, edge computing, quantum computing, communication technologies, standardization, and innovative areas related to the implementation of I4.0 in the upstream sector are presented. The findings from this review show that I4.0 technologies are currently being explored and deployed for various aspects of the upstream sector. However, some of the I4.0 technologies like additive manufacturing and virtual reality are least explored.

637,Scopus,Arrasmith et al. (2021),2021,Effect of barren plateaus on gradient-free optimization,Quantum,"Barren plateau landscapes correspond to gradients that vanish exponentially in the number of qubits. Such landscapes have been demonstrated for variational quantum algorithms and quantum neural networks with deep circuits, global cost functions, large entanglement, or hardware noise. For obvious reasons, it is expected that gradient-based optimizers will be significantly affected by barren plateaus. However, whether or not gradient-free optimizers are impacted is a topic of debate, with some arguing that gradient-free approaches are unaffected by barren plateaus. Here we show that, indeed, gradient-free optimizers do not solve the barren plateau problem. Our main result proves that cost function differences, which are the basis for making decisions in a gradient-free optimization, are exponentially suppressed in a barren plateau. Hence, without exponential precision, gradient-free optimizers will not make progress in the optimization. We numerically confirm this by training a parameterized quantum circuit in a barren plateau landscape with several gradient-free optimizers (Nelder-Mead, Powell, and COBYLA algorithms), and show that the number of shots required in the optimization grows exponentially with the number of qubits. These results provide new insight into the training landscapes of quantum neural networks and will inform the development of strategies to mitigate or avoid barren plateaus. © 2021 The Korean Association of Speech-Language Pathologists",,10.22331/Q-2021-10-05-558,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117594654&doi=10.22331%2fQ-2021-10-05-558&partnerID=40&md5=bd004c63f7c1e2f989e6bbe819eb304a,Article

(2021),2021,Modular FSO optical system design for classical and quantum optical communication systems,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Optical communication systems are picking up pace in the various industries for its many scenarios in which it can be used. This includes satellite, aircraft and ground systems for which the DLR Institute of Communications and Navigation develops laser terminals. Free Space Optics (FSO) based optical systems have different applications ranging from terrestrial to airborne to space, and thus associated requirements to these application domains vary even though primary functional goals remain the same. Furthermore, quantum communication became of interest for its inherently secure key generation process that allows two nodes to securely communicate with each other and share secrets for long term security. Out of the different use cases of free-space optical laser terminal came the concept of having a modular FSO optical system design that could quickly adapt to the changing needs from mission to mission. The idea of a modularity appeals to many despite its challenges in the beginning, but in the long run the pros outweigh the cons. The concept was realized by carefully studying different requirements from various on-going and past projects and thereafter segmenting different aspects of the optical system based on three main categories, namely; the received path, the transmitted path and the shared path. To elaborate modularity in system; a Fast Steering Mirror (FSM) can be replaced with a fold mirror for a simpler design if it is not required, or an exchangeable CPA with integrated telescope mounted at the aperture of the optical bench to allow for different magnifications and ex-aperture beam diameter, all these without major impact on other subsystems. This greatly reduces the effort involved in re-evaluating system performance in the long run.

Compared to Low Earth Orbits (LEO), QKD from a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) offers substantial advantages, such as large coverage, continuous link to ground stations (cloud cover limited), 24/7 operation (background limited), and no tracking required. As a downside, QKD from GEO comes with large link losses due to the space-ground distance, lowering the achievable key rates. From our feasibility and conceptual design study it is concluded that although link losses are high, QKD from GEO is technically feasible, and a favourable solution if the satellite needs to act as an untrusted node (that is, no security assumptions required for the space segment). However, the optimal solution, generating a higher value-for-money, is to have the possibility to operate it in trusted mode as well, as higher key rates can be obtained. But this will be at the cost of security as key material needs to be (temporarily) stored on board of the satellite. In order to arrive at a minimum required secure bit rate of ~1 bit/s in untrusted mode, two ~0.5m diameter telescopes in the space segment are required with <0.65μrad pointing accuracy each, a >1GHz entangled photon pair generation rate, in combination with ~2.5m diameter telescopes on ground, operating at 810nm wavelength. In trusted mode, with the same optical system but only using one telescope in the space segment, a factor of ~300 to ~10000 more key can be obtained.

In enhanced oil recovery water flooding projects, it is essential to optimize the flooding efficiency in a timely manner and reduce uncertainties in inter-well hydrodynamic modelling. Usually, the inter-well space parameters are assessed using interference tests or tracer- based surveillance. These methods offer such advantages as reliable information on the flow communication in the target area and the reservoir connectivity in different zones of the field. However, the duration and cost of the described surveillance technologies pose a significant drawback, and therefore alternative physical and mathematical methods with simplified forecast models are widely spread. This paper describes a method for integrating the results of dynamic marker-based inflow production surveillance in horizontal wells and the Spearman's rank-order correlation method. This approach is applied to provide better interventions for reservoir pressure maintenance, optimization of in-fill drilling, update existing hydro-dynamic models and reduce the level of uncertainty in decision making.

It is built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We conduct an in-depth study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights into designing QCNN-based feature extractors.

(2021),2021,Cloud Education Chain and Education Quality Evaluation Based on Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Algorithm,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"This paper proposes the functional model and application service implementation process of the education cloud platform application service architecture. The entire cloud application service architecture mainly includes four parts: cloud service management, cloud application service rapid creation and deployment, dynamic process configuration, and unified identity authentication. Based on the basic theory of workflow, the process status and business services of cloud application services are discussed. The BP neural network weight optimization model based on the improved quantum evolution method is studied, and a method that combines the improved quantum evolution algorithm (IQEA) and the BP algorithm to complete the back propagation neural network training is proposed, that is, the IQEA-BP algorithm. Firstly, the traditional quantum evolution algorithm is improved, and then, the improved quantum evolution algorithm is used to optimize the network weights as a whole to overcome the shortcomings of the BP algorithm that is easy to fall into the local optimum; then, we use the BP algorithm to find the better weight as the initial value to improve the training and prediction accuracy of the network. In order to enrich the school education quality evaluation system, this article adds soft indicators that can reflect school education performance on the basis of the existing ""National Education Inspection Team""indicators and uses analytical methods to prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the new evaluation indicators. The X1-X10 index data is selected as the evaluation index of the school education quality evaluation system in this paper. Testing the performance of the BP neural network, the accuracy rate of the school education quality evaluation is 93.3%, the average absolute error is 0.067, and the accuracy and recall rate of the test set grade gradient of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 are all 93%, indicating that the IQEA-BP neural network algorithm has a good effect on the evaluation of school education quality. © 2021 Hong-Xia Liu et al.",,10.1155/2021/1909345,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113731307&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f1909345&partnerID=40&md5=fc3401dbd917a940cf535d8c2e34bbfc,Article

(2021),2021,Modified Pre-emptive Priority-Based Round Robin Scheduling Algorithms with Dynamic Time Quantum: MPPBRRACBDQ and MPPBRRALBTDQ,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"Scheduling is an essential part of an operating system. The main aim of scheduling is to schedule jobs and allot them to the CPU in a balanced way. It follows a set of rules to give prioritization to various processes. This would ensure that a system serves all requests and would achieve a certain quality of service with the existing hardware. In this paper, analysis of two Round Robin Scheduling Algorithms is carried out and modifications are made to improve the two algorithms which result in a quicker completion of the processes. The performance of the proposed algorithms, MPPBRRACBDQ and MPPBRRALBTDQ, is analyzed by comparing with existing well-known algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, PS and RR and also OMDRRS (Goel et al. in Int J Adv Comput Sci Appl 7:216–221, 2016) and improved Round Robin (H. B. Parekh, S. Chaudhari (2016) Improved round robin CPU scheduling algorithm. International Conference on Global Trends in Signal Processing, Information Computing and Communication, 184–187.). In MPPBRRACBDQ, the time quantum is varied dynamically based on the remaining burst time and is multiplied by two, while in MPPBRRALBTDQ, the time quantum is dynamically assigned based on the burst time, i.e., the least burst time among the processes is chosen to be the time quantum. The results prove that the new proposed algorithms perform better than the existing algorithms. Notable improvements are observed in waiting time (WT), turnaround time (TAT) and the number of context switches. The TAT, WT and context switches are compared and graphically represented. This research is an attempt to enhance the efficiency of the scheduling by developing and implementing new scheduling algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,10.1007/978-981-16-1244-2_20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113254047&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-1244-2_20&partnerID=40&md5=258e13f031744a9368eb9064ca094532,Conference Paper

(2021),2021,Towards a complete software stack to integrate Quantum Key Distribution in a cloud environment,IEEE Access,"The coming advent of Quantum Computing promises to jeopardize current communications security, undermining the effectiveness of traditional public-key based cryptography. Different strategies (Post-Quantum or Quantum Cryptography) have been proposed to address this problem. Many techniques and algorithms based on quantum phenomena have been presented in recent years; the most relevant example is the introduction of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This approach allows to exchange cryptographic keys among parties and does not suffer from the development of quantum computation. Problems arise when this technique has to be deployed and combined with modern distributed infrastructures that heavily depend on cloud and virtualisation paradigms. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a new software stack that effortlessly introduces QKD in such environments and involves a simulation tool for Quantum Key Distribution. This software stack allows for agnostic integration, monitoring, and management of QKD, independent from a specific vendor or technology. Furthermore, a QKD simulator is presented, designed, and tested. This latter contribution is suitable as a low-level testing device, as an independent software module to check QKD protocols, and as a testbed to identify future practical enhancements.

A detection schemes are key to the study of quantum system. The quantum synchronization detection which is presented between the probe and the quantum system is always used in detection application. A probing model is established to describe the probing a qubit system in the cavity field and to reveal the effect of the environment (cavity) on the quantum synchronization occurrence as well as the interactions among environment, a qubit system and probing equipment. By adjusting the frequency of the probe, the in-phase and out-of-phase synchronization can be achieved. So the information of the probe can be used to obtain the quantum system. Simultaneously, the effect of γ3 which describes the interaction strength between the probe and environments for quantum synchronization is discussed under different the values of Ohmic dissipation index s. Finally, the machine learning method is applied to present an optimization for classification and regression of synchronization transition dependent on s and γ3.

More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with tensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of tensor networks for supervised image segmentation which allows them to operate on high resolution medical images. We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping patches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a pixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed model is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a strided tensor network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and compared to relevant baselines. The evaluation shows that the strided tensor network yields competitive performance compared to CNN-based models while using fewer resources. Additionally, based on the experiments we discuss the feasibility of using fully linear models for segmentation tasks.(Source code: https://github.com/raghavian/strided-tenet ) © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-030-78191-0_31,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111469288&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78191-0_31&partnerID=40&md5=5c7064b847ba88b036a9b98d77f4cf9e,Conference Paper

The purpose of the work is to determine the features of the model of continuing education that uses the idea of a project approach and underlies the creation of the federal network of children’s technoparks «Quantorium». Introduction At the beginning of the work, the authors give a retrospective overview of the concepts being the structural basis for the appearance of the term «children’s technopark». Based on the results of the analyses of numerous sources, the goals and objectives of the system of additional education being created on the territory of Russia, implemented in the form of a network ‘Quantorium.’ The connection between the created children’s technoparks and the implementation of the national project «Education» is emphasized. Materials and Methods A wide range of educational trajectories (directions) implemented federal network of ‘Quantoriums,’ some of which are presented in the «Quantorium-04» educational model, is given as one of the structural positions of the methodological base, the studied system of additional education. In the process of analysis, the authors use modern educational technologies used in various educational systems as patterns for conducting a comparative analysis of already proven educational concepts and approaches that underlie the newly created model of additional education. Results In this section, the authors analyze the structure of external and internal (inter-quantum) connections of the educational model ‘Quantorium-04,’ as well as the role and characteristics of the staff who are called to implement this educational model into reality. The main part of the section is devoted to the analysis of factors that, according to the authors, should be paid special attention to. We are talking about the so-called points of instability (bifurcation) of the educational model under study. As such special points, two aspects of the personnel problem are noted, two aspects associated with the complexity of the equipment used in the educational process and elements of structural and organizational feedback on the quality indicators of the educational process. Along with analytical calculations, concrete steps are proposed that could minimize the risks of problem situations and would increase the effectiveness of the educational process. Discussion In this section, as a hypothesis under discussion, it is proposed to consider a number of measures and technological methods that make it possible to optimize and make more stable the model of continuing education used not only in the Altai Republic, but also in other regional educational subsystems. In conclusion it is noted that the project approach, in particular, and the model of additional education implemented by the federal network of children’s technoparks «Quantorium», in general, is consistent with the goals and objectives of the system of additional education for youth and schoolchildren, designed to educate future engineers and scientists, who shape the basic level from which the revival of the prestige of engineering and scientific professions will begin. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,10.1007/978-981-16-0953-4_78,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111254633&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-0953-4_78&partnerID=40&md5=b20fdd67962ca3274402b2b0c70e4617,Conference Paper

However, the insatiable demand for computing resources required to train these models is fast outpacing the advancement of classical computing hardware, and new frameworks including Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) and quantum computing are being explored as future alternatives. In this work, we report a novel quantum computing based deep learning model, the Quantum Optical Convolutional Neural Network (QOCNN), to alleviate the computational bottleneck in future computer vision applications. Using the MNIST dataset, we have benchmarked this new architecture against a traditional CNN model based on the seminal LeNet architecture. We have also compared the performance against previously reported ONNs, the GridNet and ComplexNet, and a Quantum Optical Neural Network (QONN) that we built by combining the ComplexNet with quantum-inspired sinusoidal nonlinearities. Our work extends the prior research on QONN by adding quantum convolution and pooling layers. We have evaluated the models using the metrics of accuracies, confusion matrices, Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, and Matthews Correlation Coefficients. The performance of the models were similar, and the metrics indicated that the new QOCNN model is robust. Finally, we estimated the gains in computational efficiencies from executing this novel framework on a quantum computer, concluding that switching to a quantum computing based approach to deep learning may result in comparable accuracies to classical models while simultaneously achieving unprecedented boosts in computational performances and power allocation. © 2013 IEEE.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3098775,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111043225&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2021.3098775&partnerID=40&md5=d2887f2d1ba3d8b74af108f2a7cadafe,Article

In the present paper, we show that the quantum swap gates of photonic qubits can be implemented only by one step with a three-level Λ-type atom trapped in a bimodal optical cavity. The purpose for the direct construction of swap gates is to save a great many quantum resources in practical quantum information processing and reduce the number of required unitary operation. For the latter, we obtain the entangled coherent states via the large detuning interaction, in the process of the unitary evolution of dressed states. This scheme provides a suitable cavity QED to prepare quantum entanglement for researchers, and provides a wider horizon for the generation of quantum entanglement based on cavity QED, which, to some extent, possesses reference value and guiding effect in the experiment, and the quantum entanglement can be used for the potential application in the quantum information and quantum communication in the future. © 2021 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2599771,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109411992&doi=10.1117%2f12.2599771&partnerID=40&md5=21c34edc0143900e41d1012bdacf5847,Conference Paper

The underlying challenge is to understand the hidden patterns in the sequence by means of analyzing short- and long-term dependencies and temporal differences. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are widely used in problem domains like speech recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), fault prediction, and language translation modeling over the past few years. Higher accuracy demands complex LSTM network models which lead to high computational cost, area overhead, and excessive power consumption. Reversible logic circuit synthesis, in the context of ideally Zero heat dissipation, has emerged as a new research paradigm for low power circuit designs. In this paper, we have proposed a novel design of LSTM architecture using reversible logic gates. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first attempt to implement a complete feedforward LSTM circuit using only reversible logic gates. The hardware implementation of the proposed method is presented using VHDL and Altera Arria10 GX FPGA. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach has achieved an approximately 17% reduction in overall power dissipation compared to traditional networks.

However, rapid and efficient synthesis of SCWE-CQDs with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and stability remains challenging. Here, we report a novel solvent engineering strategy to obtain highly photoluminescent SCWE-CQDs by controlling the dilution ratios between N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and pristine red carbon quantum dots (RCQDs) solution. By optimizing synthesis conditions, the relative PLQY of the SCWE-CQDs solution reached 53%. Morphological, structural, and optical property characterizations indicate that the combined action of the hydrogen bond (HB) effect and the size effect leads to the blue shift of RCQDs, but the HB effect is more dominant than the particle size in causing large spectral shifts. In addition, the WLEDs with high color rendering index of 89 and remarkable reliability were obtained based on the highly photoluminescent SCWE-CQDs. This facile solvent engineering approach for synthesizing tunable emission CQDs will promote the progress of carbon-based luminescent materials for applications in optoelectronic devices. © 2021 Longshi Rao et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.",,10.1515/ntrev-2021-0036,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108153431&doi=10.1515%2fntrev-2021-0036&partnerID=40&md5=2aaff09966c2aa3a95db15e819dc09bf,Article

We introduce and evaluate critical subsystems including the QKD source, which is based on resonant-cavity Light Emitting Diodes (LED) controlled by an FPGA, and we discuss a secondary QKD source based on a fiber-coupled polarization modulator.

663,Scopus,Otgonbaatar & Datcu (2021),2021,Quantum annealer for network flow minimization in InSAR images,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar, EUSAR","Quantum Annealer (QA) is well-suited for a certain class of optimization problems which can be expressed as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. A QUBO problem belongs to the family of Integer Programming problems which are called the NP-hard optimization problems. Feasible solutions of such problems can be found by using classical optimization techniques. However, studies claim that QA can find a feasible global solution that is faster than a classical annealer for QUBO problems. Hence, it appears promising to program and use the QA-to-QUBO approach for Earth Observation. In search of the QUBO problem in the domain of Earth Observation, we examined several Inteferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications and identified a residue connection problem in the phase unwrapping procedure. In particular, we consider the residue connection problem with multiples of 2p as a QUBO problem. For this practical problem, we studied how to formulate this QUBO problem, and we examined the challenges to program the D-Wave quantum annealer, in particular, embedding the QUBO problem into our QA architecture with a so-called Pegasus topology, and the annealing parameter settings in the D-Wave quantum annealer. We then analysed the parameter effects on finding the global minimum of the residue connection problem. From these results, we derived and enhanced our insight for programming future quantum annealers; for instance, choosing real-world problems in Earth Observation, conceiving the embedding procedure, and the tuning of the annealing parameters. ©VDE VERLAG GMBH .

(2021),2021,Quantum networks in the UK,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"We describe recent progress in quantum secured optical networks in the UK. The Cambridge Quantum Network has been operating for several years with 3 nodes separated by between 5-10 km of installed fibre. All links are secured by QKD systems operating with secure key rates in excess of 1 Mb/s, the highest recorded long term key rates in a deployed network. The network operates in the presence of 100Gb/s classical traffic with no significant reduction of secure key generation rate. In addition, the Bristol Quantum Network has four nodes 1-3km apart connected in a mesh protected by two pairs of QKD systems. The network is designed to be very dynamic, switching both QKD and WDM classical traffic to enable rapid reconfiguration and is used as a testbed for QKD protected dynamic applications. The two metropolitan networks are being connected by a 410 km QKD link, with 4 spans, the longest of which operates over 129km of fibre with an attenuation of 28dB achieving secure key rates of 2.7kb/s, the longest and highest loss QKD field trial to date. A 120km extension of the UK quantum network from Cambridge to BT Labs, Adastral Park operates with fully commercially available components and is an important testbed comprising 3 intermediate nodes and operates with 5 x 100Gb/s classical channels. This helps determine how to proceed with a large-scale commercial deployment of QKD. © 2021 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2578598,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105953745&doi=10.1117%2f12.2578598&partnerID=40&md5=acbf770de61dd0810228f811563d80c7,Conference Paper

These properties make them one of the most promising emitting materials for thin film light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of the future. Although QD-LEDs have been in the focus of science for quite some time, many topics are still neglected, like the dynamics, that show the speed of switching for these LEDs. However, this knowledge could be decisive for the use of such LEDs in communication or sensor technology. This work is intended to provide an overview of the influence of the organic hole transport layer (HTL) on the dynamics of QD LEDs, since the organic semiconductors used represent a limiting factor due to their low mobility.

We demonstrate the advantages of using quantum logic and computation when applying expert knowledge such as the ability to ask imprecise (inherently probabalistic) queries and do so efficiently through large and complicated computational spaces by leveraging quantum concepts such as superposition, entanglement, parallelism, and interference to sustain and manipulate networks of quantum qubits.

Herein, we outline a scalable approach whereby the nucleation and growth of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) can be decoupled and controlled at room temperature by utilizing different ligands. We employed octylphosphonic acid (OPA) ligands to regulate the critical radius and the NC growth rate. The subsequent addition of a bulkier didodecyldimethylammonium bromide ligand quenches the NC growth, defining the reaction duration. Management of these three variables enables precise tuning of the NC diameter between 6.8 and 13.6 nm. The photoluminescence quantum yield of the NCs remains above 80% for all sizes even after thorough antisolvent purification. The use of hydrogen-bonding OPA ligands enhances quantum confinement effects, characterized by strong, well-resolved absorption peaks. Solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra confirmed the effective removal of unbound ligands during purification and the presence of a hydrogen-bonded network of OPA ligands on the surface of the purified NCs. Overall, this approach has the potential to facilitate a broad range of future endeavors from studies of hot carrier dynamics to both optically and electrically driven device applications. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c04569,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105023998&doi=10.1021%2facs.chemmater.0c04569&partnerID=40&md5=249a4f86a322e10417a5eed25d9fa53a,Article

First of all, this paper analyzes the problem in theory, and transforms the characteristics of the problem into a mathematical model. The mathematical model considers that the sensor network itself is a travelling salesman problem (TSP), but also requires the shortest path of the mobile sink node. Then, the path of each node in the sensor network is iterated by quantum annealing algorithm, and an optimal TSP path is obtained by using quantum tunneling effect and quantum circuit to achieve parallelism. Finally, in the case of compressing the solution space, the moving path of the mobile sink node is quantum coded, and the Hamiltonian in the quantum annealing algorithm is taken as the guiding factor, and then the individual dimensions are moved, which improves the accuracy of the algorithm and speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, the feasibility of EMGH is verified by simulation experiments and comparison with other algorithms, which provides a reference for the optimization and improvement of path planning method. © 2013 IEEE.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070650,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103763027&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2021.3070650&partnerID=40&md5=2941e97b26f327b3663ab373f1bc0758,Article

It can provide a high-speed Ethernet encryption while supporting the virtualization of a large network such as data center network. Although MACsec addresses most of security threats, it is not immune against quantum attacks which are a future, yet disastrous threat against public-key cryptography in use. In this paper, we demonstrate a new solution for a MACsec protocol over VXLAN in a post-quantum setting. Instead of a standard MACsec key agreement protocol, we use an ephemeral key exchange protocol and an end-to-end authentication scheme, both of which are based on post-quantum cryptography. To measure the impact on the performance, we established a quantum-secure link between Germany and Israel using MACsec in VXLAN over public IP networks.

(2021),2021,On the Security of Lattice-Based Fiat-Shamir Signatures in the Presence of Randomness Leakage,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"Leakages during the signing process, including partial key exposure and partial (or complete) randomness exposure, may be devastating for the security of digital signatures. In this work, we investigate the security of lattice-based Fiat-Shamir signatures in the presence of randomness leakage. To this end, we present a generic key recovery attack that relies on minimum leakage of randomness, and then theoretically connect it to a variant of Integer-LWE (ILWE) problem. The ILWE problem, introduced by Bootle et al. at Asiacrypt 2018, is to recover the secret vector s given polynomially many samples of the form, and it is solvable if the error is not superpolynomially larger than the inner product However, in our variant (we call the variant FS-ILWE problem in this paper) is a sparse vector whose coefficients are NOT independent any more, and e is related to a and s as well. We prove that the FS-ILWE problem can be solved in polynomial time, and present an efficient algorithm to solve it. Our generic key recovery method directly implies that many lattice-based Fiat-Shamir signatures will be totally broken with one (deterministic or probabilistic) bit of randomness leakage per signature. Our attack has been validated by experiments on two NIST PQC signatures Dilithium and qTESLA. For example, as to Dilithium-III of 125-bit quantum security, the secret key will be recovered within 10 seconds over an ordinary PC desktop, with about one million signatures. Similarly, key recovery attacks on Dilithium under other parameters and qTESLA will be completed within 20 seconds and 31 minutes respectively. In addition, we also present a non-profiled attack to show how to obtain the required randomness bit in practice through power analysis attacks on a proof-of-concept implementation of polynomial addition. The experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of our method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/TIFS.2020.3045904,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098778861&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2020.3045904&partnerID=40&md5=98e648b49734ccd6cbdc535d6922923e,Article

Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication in IoT is based on public-key cryptosystems such as the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless, the reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this article, we investigate applications of one of the postquantum signatures called hash-based signature (HBS) schemes for the security of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of HBS schemes with an emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of HBS schemes and their significance for IoT security in the quantum era. We also investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along with possible solutions.

In this paper, we propose a simple and deterministic scheme for implementing a single-photon fully quantum router by a combination of both platforms.

Our scheme has several advantages in contrast to previously published ones, and on top of that, this device meets all the requirements imposed on a fully featured quantum router and is easily scalable for multiqubit quantum routing. Moreover, it exhibits high experimental feasibility with current or near-future technologies. Therefore, this router can be integrated with protocols for the realization of quantum information processing and future complex quantum networks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11082-020-02701-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098513982&doi=10.1007%2fs11082-020-02701-1&partnerID=40&md5=1ff1fc2bed935dca8f13ff8bb92521d0,Article

Findings: The conceptual model of corporate database management on the basis of cloud, quantum, blockchain technologies and big data processing technologies on the principles of efficiency and security was developed. Scenario analysis of corporate database management on the principles of efficiency and security in the regions of the North Caucasus Federal District of the Russian Federation with the application of game theory methodology was conducted. Originality/value: It has been substantiated that the management of corporate databases based on cloud, quantum, blockchain and big data technologies to meet the criteria of efficiency and security should be organized in a systematic manner and be based on the capabilities of the region. This forms a fundamentally new scientific concept of the organization of the process under study, which reflects the view on it not from the standpoint of an isolated enterprise, but from the standpoint of the region’s enterprises. Owing to this, security is provided with the support of the state, the risks are distributed among the enterprises of the region and full-scale financing allows maximizing the advantages.

For many years, implementation of devices leveraging these properties was hampered by the lack of techniques for heteroepitaxial growth of pure diamond films, which prevented straightforward application of traditional nanophotonic fabrication techniques. Recently, new fabrication procedures have emerged and enabled the fabrication of nanostructures for various applications ranging from improved photon and phonon manipulation to cavity QED. Of particular importance is the development of freestanding diamond devices which has led to the creation of diamond photonic crystal cavities coupled to color centers. Such structures have enabled benchmark experiments towards the implementation of long-range, optically-mediated quantum networks. Furthermore, these procedures can also be used to engineer nanomechanical devices for creating coherent interactions between color centers and phonons, potentially enabling the creation of complementary shorter range, mechanically-mediated networks. Finally, optomechanical devices mediating photon-phonon interactions promise to gain further control over these two degrees of freedom as well as to enable the interfacing of quantum systems at vastly differing energy scales.

However, no effective method for predicting the demand for museum tourism has yet emerged. In order to be able to build a prediction model that can perceive the needs of museum tourists, this article uses advanced algorithms based on neural network integration and calls different algorithms: QPSO-BPNN, QPSO, PSO, PSO-BPNN, and BPNN. When the training ratio increases to 90%, the prediction accuracy of the three algorithms, BPNN, PSO, and PSO-BPNN, is less than 80%, and the prediction accuracy of the QPSO-BPNN algorithm has reached 92.5%. Under the condition of equal training set ratio, the prediction accuracy of QPSO-BPNN algorithm is always significantly higher than that of PSO-BPNN algorithm. When the training set proportions are 50%, 70%, and 90%, the changes in population size parameters have little effect on the prediction accuracy of the algorithm. Based on the above experiments, it is known that the QPSO-BPNN algorithm is less sensitive to the size of the population, and the algorithm has good robustness. With the increase in the number of initial classifiers, the prediction accuracy of the QPSO-BPNN algorithm has improved significantly. The experimental results are consistent with the previous theoretical derivation analysis, and the accuracy of the algorithm has a positive correlation with the number of classifiers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s00521-020-05012-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085278576&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-020-05012-4&partnerID=40&md5=eaa6dc993e0c956973879cd2a3393324,Article

(2020),2020,Refining aerosol optical depth retrievals over land by constructing the relationship of spectral surface reflectances through deep learning: Application to Himawari-8,Remote Sensing of Environment,"For the past two decades, quantitative retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been made from both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, and the results have been widely used in numerous studies. Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of AOD retrievals, there are still major challenges, especially over land. A notable one for the so-called Dark-Target (DT) algorithms is building the surface reflectance (SR) relationships (SRR) to derive SR in the visible channels from SR in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channel, mainly because these relationships are strongly subjected to entangled factors (e.g., viewing geometry, surface type, and vegetation state). In this study, we examine the benefits of a new method for deriving the SRR using deep learning techniques. The SRR constructed by the deep neural network (DNN) considers multiple related inputs, such as the SWIR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVISWIR), viewing geometry, and seasonality, among others. We then incorporate the DNN-constrained SRR into a DT algorithm developed at NOAA/STAR to retrieve AOD from the Advanced Himawari Instrument (AHI) onboard the new generation of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8. The revised DT algorithm with the deep learning technique (DTDL) demonstrates improved performance over the study region (95–125°E, 18–30°N, a portion of the AHI full disk), as attested by significantly reduced random noise, especially for low NDVISWIR and high surface albedo cases. Robust independent tests indicate that this algorithm can be applied to untrained regions, not only to those used in training. The method directly benefits the algorithm development for Himawari-8 and can also be adopted for other geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence could significantly improve AOD retrievals from multi-spectral satellite observations following this new approach. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.rse.2020.112093,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091220926&doi=10.1016%2fj.rse.2020.112093&partnerID=40&md5=8f900ee33e26c94b5c4420e20b19d2f3,Article

To accommodate as many security-sensitive applications as possible, in this letter, the secure key rate maximization problem for QKD enabled communication networks is investigated. By transforming the original problem into a maximum weight perfect matching problem of an undirected and non-bipartite graph, the associated quantum devices scheduling policy is optimally determined, along with the feasibility analysis as well as two simpler heuristic scheduling approaches. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the devised scheduling strategies from comprehensive perspectives, such as achievable secure key rate and outage probability. © 2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/LWC.2020.3014633,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097716734&doi=10.1109%2fLWC.2020.3014633&partnerID=40&md5=e722afac32639a88d180c7e122d5325e,Article

(2020),2020,Quantum-Based Creative Generation Method for a Dancing Robot,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,"In this paper, we propose a creative generation process model based on the quantum modeling simulation method. This model is mainly aimed at generating the running trajectory of a dancing robot and the execution plan of the dancing action. First, we used digital twin technology to establish data mapping between the robot and the computer simulation environment to realize intelligent controllability of the robot's trajectory and the dance movements described in this paper. Second, we conducted many experiments and carried out a lot of research into information retrieval, information fidelity, and result evaluation. We constructed a multilevel three-dimensional spatial quantum knowledge map (M-3DQKG) based on the coherence and entangled states of quantum modeling and simulation. Combined with dance videos, we used regions with convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to extract character bones and movement features to form a movement library. We used M-3DQKG to quickly retrieve information from the knowledge base, action library, and database, and then the system generated action models through a holistically nested edge detection (HED) network. The system then rendered scenes that matched the actions through generative adversarial networks (GANs). Finally, the scene and dance movements were integrated, and the creative generation process was completed. This paper also proposes the creativity generation coefficient as a means of evaluating the results of the creative process, combined with artificial brain electroenchalographic data to assist in evaluating the degree of agreement between creativity and needs. This paper aims to realize the automation and intelligence of the creative generation process and improve the creative generation effect and usability of dance movements. Experiments show that this paper has significantly improved the efficiency of knowledge retrieval and the accuracy of knowledge acquisition, and can generate unique and practical dance moves. The robot's trajectory is novel and changeable, and can meet the needs of dance performances in different scenes. The creative generation process of dancing robots combined with deep learning and quantum technology is a required field for future development, and could provide a considerable boost to the progress of human society. © Copyright © 2020 Mei, Ding, Jin, Zhang and Jiao.",,10.3389/fnbot.2020.559366,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097612632&doi=10.3389%2ffnbot.2020.559366&partnerID=40&md5=1d7067cbd2c92311cc31c877c0485649,Article

Part I focused on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model which is presently the most widely applied optimization model in the quantum computing area, and which unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Part II (the present paper) introduces the domain of QUBO-Plus models that enables a larger range of problems to be handled effectively. After illustrating the scope of these QUBO-Plus models with examples, we give special attention to an important instance of these models called the Asset Exchange Problem (AEP). Solutions to the AEP enable market players to identify exchanges of assets that benefit all participants. Such exchanges are generated by a combination of two optimization technologies for this class of QUBO-Plus models, one grounded in network optimization and one based on a new metaheuristic optimization approach called combinatorial chaining. This combination opens the door to expanding the links to quantum computing applications established by QUBO models through the Quantum Bridge Analytics perspective.

However, they have not met the demands in filterless narrowband photoresponse, wide linear dynamic range (LDR), ultralow dark current, and large on/off ratio, which are key performances for these applications. 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (2D-RPPs) are recently highlighted photovoltaic and optoelectronic materials. Embedding ultrathin 2D-RPPs into 2DM photodetectors holds potentials to improve these performances. Herein, a single-crystalline ultrathin (PEA)2PbI4 is integrated into a vertical-stacked graphene-(PEA)2PbI4-graphene micro photoconductor (V-PEPI-PC). V-PEPI-PC exhibits narrowband photoresponses at 517 nm with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 15 nm and a wide LDR of 122 dB. Due to the multiple quantum wells in (PEA)2PbI4, V-PEPI-PC demonstrates an ultralow dark current of 1.1 × 10−14 A (44 pA mm−2), a high specific detectivity of 1.2 × 1013 Jones, and a high on/off ratio of 1.6 × 106. Owing to the short vertical channel, V-PEPI-PC shows a fast response rise time of 486 µs.

Of particular interest is to engineer these phases on demand using ultrafast external stimuli, such as photoexcitation, which offers prospects of their integration into future devices compatible with optical communication and information technology. Here, we use MeV Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) to show how a transient three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal state can be induced by a femtosecond laser pulse in a topological insulator ZrTe5. We observe marked changes in Bragg diffraction, which are characteristic of bond distortions in the photoinduced state. Using the atomic positions refined from the UED, we perform density functional theory (DFT) analysis of the electronic band structure. Our results reveal that the equilibrium state of ZrTe5 is a topological insulator with a small band gap of ~ 25 meV, consistent with angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments. However, the gap is closed in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the photoinduced transient state, where massless Dirac fermions emerge in the chiral band structure. The time scale of the relaxation dynamics to the transient Dirac semimetal state is remarkably long, τ ~ 160 ps, which is two orders of magnitude longer than the conventional phonon-driven structural relaxation. The long relaxation is consistent with the vanishing density of states in Dirac spectrum and slow spin-repolarization of the SOC-controlled band structure accompanying the emergence of Dirac fermions. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",,10.1038/s41535-020-00280-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094970637&doi=10.1038%2fs41535-020-00280-8&partnerID=40&md5=b094ad8c2242593002a875d188d5be76,Article

Security issues, including attack management, have become increasingly important for optical communication networks because of the vulnerabilities associated with tapping light from optical fibre links. Physical layer security often requires restricting access to channels and periodic inspections of link performance. In this paper, we report how quantum communication techniques can be utilized to detect a physical layer attack. We present an efficient method for monitoring the physical layer security of a high-data-rate classical optical communication network using a modulated continuous-variable quantum signal. We describe the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of this monitoring system and the monitoring accuracy for different monitored parameters. We analyse its performance for both unamplified and amplified optical links. The technique represents a novel approach for applying quantum signal processing to practical optical communication networks and compares well with classical monitoring methods.

An inevitable challenge for realizing such chiral optoelectronics is the development of near-infrared circularly polarized (NIR CP) light-sensing photodetectors that convert optical power and circular polarization direction into distinguishable electrical signals. Herein, a simple and promising strategy for high-performance NIR CP light-sensing organic phototransistors (NIR CPL-OPTRs) applicable to highly secure optoelectronic encryption is proposed. By directly assembling a standalone cholesteric liquid-crystal network film in a thin-film NIR CPL-OPTR, remarkable responsivity and distinguishability are achieved. The synergetic effect of amplification of the photocurrent signal by the applied electric field and improved light absorption by the reduced reflection in the multilayered structure leads to high responsivity.

Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and find that its faster decay implies a more accurate memory.

The size of the pixels, however, are severely limited by the fundamental constraints of lightwave diffraction. Current development using transmissive filters and planar absorbing layers can shrink the pixel size, yet there are two major issues, optical and electrical crosstalk, that need to be addressed when the pixel dimension approaches wavelength scale. All these fundamental constraints preclude the continual reduction of pixel dimensions and enhanced performance. Here we demonstrate subwavelength scale color pixels in a CMOS compatible platform based on anti-Hermitian metasurfaces. In stark contrast to conventional pixels, spectral filtering is achieved through structural color rather than transmissive filters leading to simultaneously high color purity and quantum efficiency. As a result, this subwavelength anti-Hermitian metasurface sensor, over 28,000 pixels, is able to sort three colors over a 100 nm bandwidth in the visible regime, independently of the polarization of normally-incident light. Furthermore, the quantum yield approaches that of commercial silicon photodiodes, with a responsivity exceeding 0.25 A/W for each channel.

(2020),2020,Neural network interpolation of exchange-correlation functional,Scientific Reports,"Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used tools to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation. The core uncertainty inside DFT theory is the exchange-correlation (XC) functional, the exact form of which is still unknown. Therefore, the essential part of DFT success is based on the progress in the development of XC approximations. Traditionally, they are built upon analytic solutions in low- and high-density limits and result from quantum Monte Carlo numerical calculations. However, there is no consistent and general scheme of XC interpolation and functional representation. Many different developed parametrizations mainly utilize a number of phenomenological rules to construct a specific XC functional. In contrast, the neural network (NN) approach can provide a general way to parametrize an XC functional without any a priori knowledge of its functional form. In this work, we develop NN XC functionals and prove their applicability to 3-dimensional physical systems. We show that both the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are well reproduced by the NN approach. It is demonstrated that the local environment can be easily considered by changing only the number of neurons in the first layer of the NN. The developed NN XC functionals show good results when applied to systems that are not presented in the training/test data. The generalizability of the formulated NN XC framework leads us to believe that it could give superior results in comparison with traditional XC schemes provided training data from high-level theories such as the quantum Monte Carlo and post-Hartree-Fock methods. © 2020, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41598-020-64619-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084698048&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-64619-8&partnerID=40&md5=bf4a1d29c26b318cd262bc79ea5ea036,Article

(2020),2020,Axially Segmented Semiconductor Heteronanowires,Accounts of Materials Research,"ConspectusProgramming nanoscale functional objects into complex, sophisticated heterostructures that tremendously outperform their solo objects and even bring about exotic chemical/physical properties offers exciting routes toward a spectrum of applications in photonics and electronics. The development in synthetic chemistry over past decades has enabled a library of hybrid nanostructures, such as core-shell, patchy, dimer, hierarchical/branched ones, etc. Nevertheless, the material combinations of these non-van der Waals solids are largely limited by the rule of lattice-matched epitaxy thereof.As an emerging class of heterostructures, axially segmented nanowires (ASNWs) offer an alternative but effective approach to epitaxially integrating the conventional non-van der Waals solids. The large lattice-mismatch tolerance in ASNWs permits vast material combinations, broad size modulations, and flexible interfacial strain engineering, signifying the great potentials for engineering their photon utilizations, band structures, features of charge carriers or excitons, and some other emerging properties. Unfortunately, ASNWs with on-demand, high-precision control over composition, shape, dimension, crystal phase, interface, and periodicity remain so far synthetically challenging.By steering the chemoselective reactions, one has access to high-precision ASNWs. In this Account, we describe the state-of-the-art synthetic strategies for chemoselectivity control. We categorize them into (i) unidirectional/bidirectional sequential additions, which include selective area epitaxy, catalyzed growth, and end-facet-seeded growth, and (ii) regiospecific one-off transformations, which include ionic exchange reaction, strain/thermal induced phase segregation and transition, Plateau-Rayleigh instability, regioselective heterogeneous nucleation as ruled by lattice match, defect, and surface charges, and nanomasking. We uncover the chemical principles behind from thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. Then we further offer insights into their fundamental physics (including carrier/photon/phonon confinement, mixed dimensionality, quantum dot-nanowire interaction, and interdot coupling effect) that are strongly correlated with a spectrum of applications, highlighting how the precise control of compositions and structures ultimately dictates their properties and functions. In the end, we conclude by describing current challenges and future directions of this field in terms of material synthesis, growth mechanism, exotic physics, and performance optimization. By crafting ASNWs at atomic precision, high-performance ASNWs with sophisticated electronic and phonon structures can be envisioned ultimately for applications in diverse fields, spanning from solar energy conversion and thermoelectrics to optoelectronics and quantum communications. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

718,Scopus,Biler et al. (2020),2020,Ground-State Destabilization by Active-Site Hydrophobicity Controls the Selectivity of a Cofactor-Free Decarboxylase,Journal of the American Chemical Society,"Bacterial arylmalonate decarboxylase (AMDase) and evolved variants have become a valuable tool with which to access both enantiomers of a broad range of chiral arylaliphatic acids with high optical purity. Yet, the molecular principles responsible for the substrate scope, activity, and selectivity of this enzyme are only poorly understood to date, greatly hampering the predictability and design of improved enzyme variants for specific applications. In this work, empirical valence bond and metadynamics simulations were performed on wild-type AMDase and variants thereof to obtain a better understanding of the underlying molecular processes determining reaction outcome. Our results clearly reproduce the experimentally observed substrate scope and support a mechanism driven by ground-state destabilization of the carboxylate group being cleaved by the enzyme. In addition, our results indicate that, in the case of the nonconverted or poorly converted substrates studied in this work, increased solvent exposure of the active site upon binding of these substrates can disturb the vulnerable network of interactions responsible for facilitating the AMDase-catalyzed cleavage of CO2. Finally, our results indicate a switch from preferential cleavage of the pro-(R) to the pro-(S) carboxylate group in the CLG-IPL variant of AMDase for all substrates studied. This appears to be due to the emergence of a new hydrophobic pocket generated by the insertion of the six amino acid substitutions, into which the pro-(S) carboxylate binds. Our results allow insight into the tight interaction network determining AMDase selectivity, which in turn provides guidance for the identification of target residues for future enzyme engineering. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/jacs.0c10701,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096883139&doi=10.1021%2fjacs.0c10701&partnerID=40&md5=e9e69c3dabfcf82c2c9afd3134b9bb46,Article

Although continued progress in the fabrication and control of qubits is required, quantum computing scalability will depend as well on a comprehensive architectural design considering a distributed multi-core approach as an alternative to the traditional monolithic version, hence including a communications perspective. However, this goes beyond introducing mere interconnects. Rather, it implies consolidating the full communications stack in the quantum computer structure. In this paper, we propose a double full-stack architecture encompassing quantum computation and quantum communications, which we use to address the monolithic versus distributed question with a structured design methodology. For that, we revisit the different quantum computing layers to capture and model their essence by highlighting the open design variables and performance metrics. Using behavioral models and actual measurements from existing quantum computers, the results of simulations suggest that multicore architectures may effectively unleash the full quantum computer potential. © 2020 IEEE.",,10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268630,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098618070&doi=10.1109%2fDCIS51330.2020.9268630&partnerID=40&md5=53b8ab40611db161feb1af8c514ff0bd,Conference Paper

In this study, a photo-tunable organic memory device based on poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP) and N-doped carbon quantum dot nanocomposites is presented. After UV light irradiation, the set voltage of the device can be gradually reduced by adjusting the irradiation time. This memory device presents excellent memory performance after large-angle bending or repetitive bending tests. More importantly, the controlled switching voltage characteristic enabled the realization of encrypted image storage. Raman spectra evidence that a local conductive sp2-hybridized carbon region was generated through UV light reduction, which can effectively enhance the internal electrical field and shorten the tunneling distance between the carbon dots, thus decreasing the set voltage.

723,Scopus,Topolnicki et al. (2020),2020,Deciphering High-Order Structural Correlations within Fluxional Molecules from Classical and Quantum Configurational Entropy,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,"We employ the kth nearest-neighbor estimator of configurational entropy in order to decode within a parameter-free numerical approach the complex high-order structural correlations in fluxional molecules going much beyond the usual linear, bivariate correlations. This generic entropy-based scheme for determining many-body correlations is applied to the complex configurational ensemble of protonated acetylene, a prototype for fluxional molecules featuring large-Amplitude motion. After revealing the importance of high-order correlations beyond the simple two-coordinate picture for this molecule, we analyze in detail the evolution of the relevant correlations with temperature as well as the impact of nuclear quantum effects down to the ultralow temperature regime of 1 K. We find that quantum delocalization and zero-point vibrations significantly reduce all correlations in protonated acetylene in the deep quantum regime. Even at low temperatures up to about 100 K, most correlations are essentially absent in the quantum case and only gain importance at higher temperatures. In the high temperature regime, beyond roughly 800 K, the increasing thermal fluctuations are found to exert a destructive effect on the presence of correlations. At intermediate temperatures of approximately 100-800 K, a quantum-To-classical cross-over regime is found where classical mechanics starts to correctly describe trends in the correlations whereas it even qualitatively fails below 100 K. Finally, a classical description of the nuclei provides correlations that are in quantitative agreement with the quantum ones only at temperatures exceeding 1000 K. This data-intensive analysis has been made possible due to recent developments of machine learning techniques based on high-dimensional neural network potential energy surfaces in full dimensionality that allow us to exhaustively sample both the classical and quantum ensemble of protonated acetylene at essentially converged coupled cluster accuracy from 1 to more than 1000 K. The presented non-parametric analysis of correlations beyond usual linear two-coordinate terms is transferable to other system classes. The technique is also expected to complement and guide the analysis of experimental measurements, in particular multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy, by revealing the complex coupling between various degrees of freedom. ©",,10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00642,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095975165&doi=10.1021%2facs.jctc.0c00642&partnerID=40&md5=bd85893ab80a1f58c4b17bf3bf45e84c,Article

In this paper, we first propose a new multi-GPU programming methodology called MG-BSP which constructs a virtual BSP machine on top of modern multi-GPU platforms, and apply this methodology to build a multi-GPU density matrix quantum simulator called DM-Sim. We propose a new formulation that can significantly reduce communication overhead, and show that this formula transformation can conserve the semantics despite noise being introduced. We build the tool-chain for the simulator to run open standard quantum assembly code, execute synthesized quantum circuits, and perform ultra-deep and largescale simulations. We evaluated DM-Sim on several state-of-theart multi-GPU platforms including NVIDIA's PascaUVolta DGX1, DGX-2, and ORNL's Summit supercomputer. In particular, we have demonstrated the simulation of one million general gates in 94 minutes on DGX-2, far deeper circuits than has been demonstrated in prior works.

726,Scopus,Ben-David & Blais (2020),2020,A new minimax theorem for randomized algorithms (extended abstract),"Proceedings - Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS","The celebrated minimax principle of Yao (1977) says that for any Boolean-valued function f with finite domain, there is a distribution mu over the domain of f such that computing f to error epsilon against inputs from mu is just as hard as computing f to error epsilon on worst-case inputs. Notably, however, the distribution mu depends on the target error level epsilon: The hard distribution which is tight for bounded error might be trivial to solve to small bias, and the hard distribution which is tight for a small bias level might be far from tight for bounded error levels. In this work, we introduce a new type of minimax theorem which can provide a hard distribution mu that works for all bias levels at once. We show that this works for randomized query complexity, randomized communication complexity, some randomized circuit models, quantum query and communication complexities, approximate polynomial degree, and approximate logrank. We also prove an improved version of Impagliazzo's hardcore lemma. Our proofs rely on two innovations over the classical approach of using Von Neumann's minimax theorem or linear programming duality. First, we use Sion's minimax theorem to prove a minimax theorem for ratios of bilinear functions representing the cost and score of algorithms. Second, we introduce a new way to analyze low-bias randomized algorithms by viewing them as'forecasting algorithms' evaluated by a certain proper scoring rule. The expected score of the forecasting version of a randomized algorithm appears to be a more fine-grained way of analyzing the bias of the algorithm. We show that such expected scores have many elegant mathematical properties: For example, they can be amplified linearly instead of quadratically. We anticipate forecasting algorithms will find use in future work in which a fine-grained analysis of small-bias algorithms is required. © 2020 IEEE.",,10.1109/FOCS46700.2020.00045,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100332422&doi=10.1109%2fFOCS46700.2020.00045&partnerID=40&md5=0228a00e4acb9c7b1358530ef272ac81,Conference Paper

In this paper, we model a photon to exciton interface based on an optically active gate-defined quantum dot (OAQD) embedded in a carefully designed photonic crystal cavity constraining its emission profile via the Purcell effect while maintaining a low enough quality factor to allow for electrical tuning of the emission wavelength. By matching the in-plane k-vector of a cavity mode and the reciprocal lattice constant of the photonic crystal, vertical emission is obtained. A back-reflection mirror located below the cavity and integrated as part of an already predefined process flow allows for not only the increasing of the light extraction efficiency but also the tailoring of the extracted beam profile to match that of a single mode fiber. We numerically show that a photon emitted by the OAQD can be coupled to the targeted free-space Gaussian beam with a probability above 50%, limited by electrode absorption.

732,Scopus,Lawless (2020),2020,Quantum-like interdependence theory advances autonomous human–machine teams (A-HMTs),Entropy,"As humanity grapples with the concept of autonomy for human–machine teams (A-HMTs), unresolved is the necessity for the control of autonomy that instills trust. For non-autonomous systems in states with a high degree of certainty, rational approaches exist to solve, model or control stable interactions; e.g., game theory, scale-free network theory, multi-agent systems, drone swarms. As an example, guided by artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning, ML) or by human operators, swarms of drones have made spectacular gains in applications too numerous to list (e.g., crop management; mapping, surveillance and fire-fighting systems; weapon systems). But under states of uncertainty or where conflict exists, rational models fail, exactly where interdependence theory thrives. Large, coupled physical or information systems can also experience synergism or dysergism from interdependence. Synergistically, the best human teams are not only highly interdependent, but they also exploit interdependence to reduce uncertainty, the focus of this work-in-progress and roadmap. We have long argued that interdependence is fundamental to human autonomy in teams. But for A-HMTs, no mathematics exists to build from rational theory or social science for their design nor safe or effective operation, a severe weakness. Compared to the rational and traditional social theory, we hope to advance interdependence theory first by mapping similarities between quantum theory and our prior findings; e.g., to maintain interdependence, we previously established that boundaries reduce dysergic effects to allow teams to function (akin to blocking interference to prevent quantum decoherence). Second, we extend our prior findings with case studies to predict with interdependence theory that as uncertainty increases in non-factorable situations for humans, the duality in two-sided beliefs serves debaters who explore alternatives with tradeoffs in the search for the best path going forward. Third, applied to autonomous teams, we conclude that a machine in an A-HMT must be able to express itself to its human teammates in causal language however imperfectly. © 2020 by the author.

In this work, metal-oxide semiconductors for use as optical memory devices are accomplished through a heterojunction channel layer which acts as a quantum confinement architecture confining electrons to the front channel. Compared to conventional memories, which rely on electron injections that cause hot electron degradation, the proposed device is based on a floating body effect. After irradiation, photo-excited carriers are separated under a lateral electrical field, and generated holes are left in the back channel, which facilitates data storage behavior. Beneficial characteristics include a memory window (≈4.6 V), a high on/off ratio (≈106), and low operating voltage (&lt;20 V). Furthermore, photo-excited carriers are only generated when irradiated by ultraviolet light, leading to a visible-blind optical memory. A retention of more than 10 years and endurance cycle of more than 1000 cycles demonstrate its nonvolatile behaviors.

Artificial intelligence and time series-based models are used for day ahead electricity price forecasting. Such models necessitate massive training inputs for accurate forecasting, which leads to high processing time. However, fast and accurate forecasts are required for real time decision making in market operations. Therefore, this paper proposes three support vector regression forecasting models for day ahead electricity price forecasting. Proposed models use limited quantum of training inputs as they use similar day approach for forecasting. Also, proposed model use GA and PSO based hyper parameter optimization for improving forecasting accuracy. Data collected from Indian power market is used for performance evaluation. Performance of proposed models are compared with linear regression and artificial neural network models. Results show that proposed models have very strong potential towards day ahead electricity price forecasting. © 2020 IEEE.",,10.1109/IPRECON49514.2020.9315258,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100017162&doi=10.1109%2fIPRECON49514.2020.9315258&partnerID=40&md5=e1e0616d0bc376885d4b10d7136bbf91,Conference Paper

Recently, they have become an excellent platform to study non-Hermitian physics and exceptional points by judiciously tailoring modal coupling and gain-loss distribution. Typical configurations include two or more coupled optical resonators, hybrid resonator-scatterer systems, and a single resonator with complex index modulation. In this chapter, we summarize the recent progress of non-Hermitian optical microresonators especially parity-time symmetric microcavities with balanced gain and loss and their applications in light transport, laser mode management, optical sensing, and optomechanics. These studies not only unveil the intriguing features associated with non-Hermitian physics and exceptional points but also provide new degrees of freedom to design optical systems with novel functionalities. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The optical amplification is realized by exciting the PbS quantum dots coated around the tapered single-mode fiber coupler with an evanescent wave. The gain spectra and saturation properties of the SQDFA are obtained via solving the rate and coupled power equations based on the two-level model. Then, the effect of the signal wavelength, pump power and amplifier length on the saturation characteristics is numerically simulated. The obtained results show that the proposed model is in a good agreement with the previous experimental results. Unique characteristics of the SQDFA such as the broadband optical gain and smooth bandwidth are of great interest for dense wavelength-division multiplexing systems.

Here, we report a comprehensive theoretical study on the dynamics of H2O adsorption on Pt(110)-(1 × 2) based on a neural network potential energy surface (PES) fit to thousands of density functional theory data points. This PES allows us to investigate the dynamics of molecular and dissociative adsorption of water on Pt(110)-(1 × 2) from first principles with no adjustable parameters. Specifically, we find a molecular adsorption well depth that is close to the experimental estimate with no entry barrier, leading to a monotonic decrease in initial sticking probability (S0) with increasing translational energy. While this translational energy dependence of S0 is consistent with the conventional mechanism for nonactivated adsorption and with earlier theoretical results, it is in qualitative disagreement with experimental data. Using an electronic friction model implemented with the local density friction approximation, we find that the low-energy electron-hole pair excitation mildly increases the trapping probability, whereas it has little influence on the translational energy dependence. Other possible factors, such as the rotational alignment and dynamical steering, which may be relevant to the discrepancy between theory and experiment, have also been discussed. On the other hand, the dissociative sticking probability is predicted as complementary information awaiting experimental confirmation. We hope that these results could motivate future experimental and theoretical studies to explore this puzzling gas-surface system. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c07182,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096833110&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpcc.0c07182&partnerID=40&md5=afc73a8946a01abd2ffc82962cbf83f4,Article

For high-quality, reproducible, and scalably manufacturable qubits, the ability to fabricate Josephson junctions (JJs) with a targeted critical current and high uniformity is essential. We use first-principles modeling to assess fundamental aspects of the atomic structure of both amorphous and crystalline aluminum oxide tunnel junctions and relate the structure to predicted performance metrics. We use modified ab initio molecular dynamics to develop realistic models of the tunnel junction, from which interface roughness and local thickness fluctuations are analyzed in an unbiased manner by training a neural network to identify the boundary between metal and oxide. We show that the effective thickness of the insulating part of the junction can be different from the apparent physical thickness. We calculate the rate of Cooper pair tunneling for the atomically resolved electrostatic potential using direct numerical solution in 3D, which shows a channeling effect that impacts the junction critical current. The predicted critical current is a useful JJ design parameter that can be accessed from the ab initio calculations without fitting parameters. To assess the limits of uniformity and fabrication choices (e.g., oxidation vs epitaxy), we compare the amorphous junctions to crystalline models, which show order of magnitude more efficient tunneling compared to the amorphous case, underlining the connection between atomistic structure and Cooper pair tunneling efficiency. Further, this work provides a foundation for ab initio materials design and evaluation to help accelerate future development of improved tunnel junctions. © 2020 Author(s).",,10.1063/5.0020292,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093922067&doi=10.1063%2f5.0020292&partnerID=40&md5=24c9f5f9046717dccfeb85d13bd839e8,Article

Information traveling in the network needs security and privacy. There are various cryptographic algorithms available today that can secure messages and data being communicated. Symmetric cryptography, though simple, does not provide authorization efficiently. Asymmetric cryptography proves to be more secure as it provides all the components of information security.With the breakthrough development on the Internet-of- Things (IOT), any digital device can become an originator of data. The main concern which arises is how to protect these data. With an accelerated usage of IoT environment, the security of data collected and stored by these devices has become more crucial.In this paper, we discuss two asymmetric algorithms NTRU (Nth degree truncated polynomial ring) and RSA (Rivest- Shamir-Adleman) in context of IoT. RSA is widely used but is heavy on key size and computation complexity. On the other hand, NTRU can give the same level of bit security with comparative key size and very less computational complexity. The captivity of NTRU algorithm lies in the fact that it works on simple polynomial operations. It is a NP-hard problem based on shortest vector problem (SVP) and is secure even for future quantum attacks. In a resource constrained environment like IoT environment, the performance of RSA and NTRU has been analyzed on the various security level parameters, viz. key generation, encryption and decryption time.

However, accurate modelings of the Kitaev materials by including realistic couplings beyond the pure Kitaev model constitute a major challenge for the community. With recently developed exponential tensor-network approach, we clear the pathway and perform finite-temperature simulations of the extended Kitaev model with additional interactions common in real materials. At intermediate temperature, we find an emergent Curie law of magnetic susceptibility and a stripy spin-structure factor characterizing the robust Kitaev fractional liquid. With this insight, we revisit the susceptibility measurements of Na2IrO3 and α-RuCl3 and find evidence of ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling and finite-temperature fractionalization.

As today's design and use of the Internet solely rests on the interconnection of classical computing devices, the development of hardware should take this dependence on an existing market into account. One might think quantum secure communication would be such a use case, but the entire design of the current Internet is built on the end-to-end argument and may reject the idea of implementing security as a physical layer protocol. On the other hand, higher data rates and reduced latency have been successfully used as key arguments for the conception of new communication standards. We thus argue that exactly these two figures of merit should be used again. We define two new initial stages of development of the quantum Internet, where in the first phase entanglement is only generated and used between network nodes, and in second phase entanglement swapping and thus distribution of entanglement over increasing distances becomes possible.

(2020),2020,High-capacity measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication,Quantum Information Processing,"As an important branch of quantum communication, quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) can directly transmit secure information between two communication parties without keys. Measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication (MDI–QSDC) is immune to all the attacks at detector’s side and thus can eliminate the security loopholes associated with measurement devices. Existing MDI–QSDC protocols encode secure information in only one degree of freedom (DOF) of photons. In this paper, we propose a high-capacity MDI–QSDC protocol by encoding secure information in photons’ polarization and spatial-mode DOFs. With hyper-encoding in two DOFs, we can double photons’ channel capacity and effectively increase MDI–QSDC’s communication efficiency. Moreover, for each encoded qudit, the states in two DOFs are totally independent. If a detection failure or error occurs on one DOF, the state in the other DOF can still be used to transmit secure information. This hyper-encoding MDI–QSDC may have potential applications in future quantum communication. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11128-020-02864-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091285222&doi=10.1007%2fs11128-020-02864-6&partnerID=40&md5=9c1c1078ec7230985e1fce485bdfef6c,Article

For the high-resolution SAR image segmentation with such noises, the conventional methods based on pulse coupled neural networks (PCNN) have to face heavy parameters with a low efficiency. In order to solve the problems, this paper proposes a novel SAR image segmentation algorithm based on non-subsampling Contourlet transform (NSCT) denoising and quantum immune genetic algorithm (QIGA) improved PCNN models. The proposed method first denoising the SAR images for a pre-processing based on NSCT. Then, by using the QIGA to select parameters for the PCNN models, such models self-adaptively select the suitable parameters for segmentation of SAR images with different scenes. This method decreases the number of parameters in the PCNN models and improves the efficiency of PCNN models. At last, by using the optimal threshold to binary the segmented SAR images, the small objects and large scales from the original SAR images will be segmented. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, four different comparable experiments are applied to validate the proposed algorithm. Experimental results have shown that NSCT pre-processing has a better performance for coherent speckle noises suppression, and QIGA-PCNN model based on denoised SAR images has an obvious segmentation performance improvement on region consistency and region contrast than state-of-the-arts methods. Besides, the segmentation efficiency is also improved than conventional PCNN model, and the level of time complexity meets the state-of-the-arts methods. Our proposed NSCT+QIGA-PCNN model can be used for small object segmentation and large scale segmentation in high-resolution SAR images.

762,Scopus,Gifford et al. (2020),2020,Controlling defect-state photophysics in covalently functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes,Accounts of Chemical Research,"ConspectusSingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) show promise as light sources for modern fiber optical communications due to their emission wavelengths tunable via chirality and diameter dependency. However, the emission quantum yields are relatively low owing to the existence of low-lying dark electronic states and fast excitonic diffusion leading to carrier quenching at defects. Covalent functionalization of SWCNTs addresses this problem by brightening their infrared emission. Namely, introduction of sp3-hybridized defects makes the lowest energy transitions optically active for some defect geometries and enables further control of their optical properties. Such functionalized SWCNTs are currently the only material exhibiting room-temperature single photon emission at telecom relevant infrared wavelengths. While this fluorescence is strong and has the right wavelength, functionalization introduces a variety of emission peaks resulting in spectrally broad inhomogeneous photoluminescence that prohibits the use of SWCNTs in practical applications. Consequently, there is a strong need to control the emission diversity in order to render these materials useful for applications. Recent experimental and computational work has attributed the emissive diversity to the presence of multiple localized defect geometries each resulting in distinct emission energy. This Account outlines methods by which the morphology of the defect in functionalized SWCNTs can be controlled to reduce emissive diversity and to tune the fluorescence wavelengths. The chirality-dependent trends of emission energies with respect to individual defect morphologies are explored. It is demonstrated that defect geometries originating from functionalization of SWCNT carbon atoms along bonds with strong π-orbital mismatch are favorable. Furthermore, the effect of controlling the defect itself through use of different chemical groups is also discussed. Such tunability is enabled due to the formation of specific defect geometries in close proximity to other existing defects. This takes advantage of the changes in π-orbital mismatch enforced by existing defects and the resulting changes in reactivities toward formation of specific defect morphologies. Furthermore, the trends in emissive energies are highly dependent on the value of mod(n-m,3) for an (n,m) tube chirality. These powerful concepts allow for a targeted formation of defects that emit at desired energies based on SWCNT single chirality enriched samples. Finally, the impact of functionalization with specific types of defects that enforce certain defect geometries due to steric constraints in bond lengths and angles to the SWCNT are discussed. We further relate to a similar effect that is present in systems where high density of surface defects is formed due to high reactant concentration. The outlined strategies suggested by simulations are instrumental in guiding experimental efforts toward the generation of functionalized SWCNTs with tunable emission energies.

While AM is widespread and relevant for a range of applications, implementation in industry has outpaced our fundamental understanding of polymer dynamics and structure development during the printing process. Characterization and quantification of such dynamics is necessary to optimize final material properties and design future materials and processes for 3D printing. Here, we utilize X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to measure spatial and time-resolved, out-of-equilibrium dynamics during direct ink write (DIW) 3D printing. Specifically, we investigate the progression of structural dynamics in a dual cure (UV/thermal) nanocomposite during and directly after printing. As the filament is printed and cured in situ, the relaxation processes of the cross-linking network are measured through the dynamics of inorganic filler particles. The characteristic relaxation time of the dynamics is calculated through the intensity-intensity autocorrelation functiong2and directly correlated to the printing process parameters, such as printhead velocity and UV light intensity. The time-resolved evolution of nanoscale dynamics follows a power-law dependence as the filament is cured. Bulk rheological characterizations reveal the macroscopic solidification of the resin, providing correlation of material properties across a wide range of length and time scales. The measurement of multiscale, out-of-equilibrium dynamics provides insight into the development of structure in polymer nanocomposite filaments during 3D printing and is used to further understand the influence of such parameters on the AM process.

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and - due to their long life span - also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes.

Based on these findings, a 19.5% (2000 lux indoor light) and an 11.6% efficiency (1.5 Suns) have been facilely realized from ordinary QDSCs (9.55% under 1 Sun). To further illustrate the potential of the MPA in QDSCs, 21.29% efficiency polymer lens CPVs (4.08 Suns) and viable sensor networks powered by indoor QDSCs matrix have been demonstrated. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH",,10.1002/adfm.202004563,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089250970&doi=10.1002%2fadfm.202004563&partnerID=40&md5=e773e2582248fe6ce8dc0ad0a66f46c2,Article

(2020),2020,Two novel semi-quantum-reflection protocols applied in connected vehicle systems with blockchain,Computers and Electrical Engineering,"The increasing evolution of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is bringing about a crucial challenge in information security, which is typically classified into network and large data storage security areas. A quantum cryptosystem is secure against cloning, and is thus immune to many types of traditional network attacks. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology based on a game theory consensus, and has already shown significant advantages in terms of data security. In this study, a method to extend the use of quantum and blockchain technologies in the security of IoV is considered. Herein, we present a semi-quantum system with a blockchain architecture and provide two lightweight approaches for its application to IoV with unconditional security and a single round of completion. Moreover, with our two protocols, only two modular exponentiations are applied, and the remaining computations are hash or XOR operations, which can be ignored. The results of our study may provide a guide for future applications toward IoV in the era of quantum and blockchain technologies. © 2020",,10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106714,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086408159&doi=10.1016%2fj.compeleceng.2020.106714&partnerID=40&md5=9d9e0c359f31d4e544d2f613e356b505,Article
774,Scopus,Feng et al. (2020),2020,Evolution of linear and nonlinear optical responses in single- And double-dressing quadphoton correlations,Optics Express,"Research on entangled multipartite systems with controllable wave functions has attracted significant interest in the field of quantum optics. For quantum communications and quantum information processing, linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities govern high-order correlations and entangled multiple-photon resources. In single- and double-dressing quadphoton correlations, we have observed the evolution of linear and nonlinear optical responses in the group delay and Rabi oscillation regimes. In the group delay regime, when linear susceptibility is evident, the quadphoton coincidence counting rate exhibits a rectangular profile. In the Rabi oscillation regime, the enhanced nonlinear susceptibility induced by strong laser dressing effects control quadphoton wave packets based on damped Rabi oscillation. Additionally, at different delay times, some photons exist in the group delay regimes, while others exist in the Rabi oscillation regimes, suggesting a coexistence mechanism. Additionally, there is a transition regime in which a portion of the photons are in both the group delay and Rabi oscillation regimes. By varying the power of the dressing field and optical depth, we realized the evolution between these two regimes for entangled quadphotons. Additionally, we demonstrate the shortening of coherence times under double-dressing conditions compared to single-dressing conditions. These results can help improving the length of coherence time and information capacity, which have great significance for the future development of long-distance and long coherent time quantum communication and quantum storage. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",,10.1364/OE.395780,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090380789&doi=10.1364%2fOE.395780&partnerID=40&md5=811fe0d4411b22e4350935ab9793c5cc,Article

In this work, by endorsing the molecular symmetry and elementals of group theory, we propose a comprehendible method to apply symmetry in the graph neural network (SY-GNN), which extends the property-predicting coverage to orbital symmetry for both ground and excited states. SY-GNN is an end-to-end model that can predict multiple properties in both K and R space within a single model, and it shows excellent performance in predicting both the absolute and relative R and K space quantities. Besides the numerical properties, SY-GNN can also predict orbital properties, providing the active regions of chemical reactions. We believe the symmetry-endorsed deep learning scheme covers the significant physics inside and is essential for the application of neural networks in QC and many other research fields in the future.

In the present study, we have considered three aqueous solutions of metal nitrates to investigate the effects of divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+), compared to that of monovalent Na+ ions, on hydrogen-bond fluctuations and vibrational spectral diffusion through calculations of linear and two-dimensional infrared spectra of these solutions at room temperature. We have employed the methods of molecular dynamics simulations using effective polarizable models of ions combined with quantum mechanical calculations of transition variables and statistical mechanical calculations of spectral response functions of vibrational spectroscopy. Divalent cations are found to have much stronger and longer-ranged effects on the structure and dynamics of the hydrogen-bonded network than that induced by the monovalent sodium ions. The blue shifts in the calculated linear spectra are found to follow the Hofmeister trend for the cations. The 2D-IR spectral lineshape and intensity corresponding to three-pulse echo peak shift (3PEPS) experiments are calculated. The timescales of these nonlinear spectral responses and also frequency-time correlations show significant slowing down of spectral diffusion for solutions containing divalent Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions compared to the corresponding dynamics of the solution containing Na+ ions. Unlike NaNO3 solution, the relaxation of frequency and dipole orientational fluctuations of anion-bound water in Mg(NO3)2 and Ca(NO3)2 solutions are found to be somewhat slower than bulk water, which can be attributed to the presence of divalent cations whose effects go beyond their first solvation shells. This is also seen in the dynamics of bulk water in these solutions which is found to be notably slower for the solutions containing divalent cations than that in the NaNO3 solution. Unlike Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, no specific cationic effect is observed for the Na+ ions.

(2020),2020,Strong statistical correlation revealed by quantum entanglement for supervised learning,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,"In supervised learning, the generative approach is an important one, which obtains the generative model by learning the joint probability between features and categories. In quantum mechanics, Quantum Entanglement (QE) can provide a statistical correlation between subsystems (or attributes) that is stronger than what classical systems are able to produce. It inspires us to use entangled systems (states) to characterize this strong statistical correlation between features and categories, that is, to use the joint probability derived from QE to model the correlation. Based on the separability of the density matrix of entangled systems, this paper formally clarifies the manifestation of the strong statistical correlation revealed by QE, and implements a classification algorithm (called ECA) to verify the feasibility and superiority of the correlation in specific tasks. Since QE arises from the measurement process of entangled systems, the core of ECA is quantum measurement operations. In this paper, we use the GHZ [25] and W [22] states to prepare the entangled system and use a fully connected network layer to learn the measurement operator. It can also be understood as replacing the output layer of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a quantum measurement operation. The experimental results show that ECA is superior to most representative classification algorithms in multiple evaluation metrics. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",,10.3233/FAIA200276,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091741433&doi=10.3233%2fFAIA200276&partnerID=40&md5=5c5101a35ca23677262c32a13035058a,Conference Paper

In the multipartite setting, similar questions of the optimally achievable rates of transforming one pure state into another are notoriously open. This seems particularly unfortunate in the light of the revived interest in such questions due to the perspective of experimentally realizing multipartite quantum networks. In this Letter, we report substantial progress by deriving simple upper and lower bounds on the rates that can be achieved in asymptotic multipartite entanglement transformations. These bounds are based on ideas of entanglement combing and state merging. We identify cases where the bounds coincide and hence provide the exact rates. As an example, we bound rates at which resource states for the cryptographic scheme of quantum secret sharing can be distilled from arbitrary pure tripartite quantum states.

Two diamond formats were used enabling extracellular studies of cells cultured directly on a planar diamond plate and intracellular studies via endocytosis mediated integration of nanoscale diamond particles within cells. Over a 14 days culture period functional neuronal networks formed as confirmed by endogenous calcium transients detected via fluorescent imaging of a calcium probe (Fluo-5 AM). Spatially correlated images of photoluminescence from NV centers were also recorded demonstrating successful acquisition of optically detected magnetic resonance from regions of endogenously firing neuronal cultures. Further, a fast and simple measurement protocol based on acquisition of NV photoluminescence without and with the application of near resonant microwaves is presented. This protocol was applied to live signaling cells and dead cells. The relative photoluminescence from NVs with and without microwaves varied for the case of live as compared to dead cells warranting future investigation. Overall this work presents a protocol for integration of NV diamond sensors in a spontaneously active network of neuronal cells of relevance to the field of neuroscience. Photoluminescence from NV centers was detected with high spatiotemporal resolution using measurement protocols potentially capable of single shot detection of neuronal activity. It is anticipated that the methodologies introduced in this work will underpin the establishment of NV diamond sensors as a radically new measurement platform capable of rapid, non-destructive functional studies of cells. © Copyright © 2020 Price, Mesquita-Ribeiro, Dajas-Bailador and Mather.",,10.3389/fphy.2020.00255,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089887059&doi=10.3389%2ffphy.2020.00255&partnerID=40&md5=28d7d3eee29734d0a6611b0c66300448,Article

(2020),2020,Quantum adversarial machine learning,Physical Review Research,"Adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that focuses on studying vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and developing techniques accordingly to make learning robust to adversarial manipulations. It plays a vital role in various machine learning applications and recently has attracted tremendous attention across different communities. In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals another perspective in bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on both near-term and future quantum technologies. © 2020 authors.

Thus, controlling the excitonic properties is essential for the applications of TMD-based devices. Here, we demonstrate the all-optical tuning of the local excitonic emission from a monolayer MoS2 hybridized with phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) thin film. By applying pulsed laser with different power on the MoS2/GST heterostructure, the peak energies of the excitonic emission of MoS2 can be tuned up to 40 meV, and the exciton/trion intensity ratio can be tuned by at least one order of magnitude. Raman spectra and transient pump-probe measurements show that the tunability originated from the laser-induced phase change of the GST thin film with charge transferring from GST to the monolayer MoS2. The dynamic tuning of the excitonic emission was all done with localized laser pulses and could be scaled readily, which pave a new way of controlling the excitonic emission in TMDs.

In this article, a self-powered near-infrared light detector with a narrowband at around 1060 nm is realized based on a simple Si Schottky structure, in which the Ohmic and Schottky electrodes are configured on the front and rear surfaces of the Si substrate, respectively. The as-assembled device exhibits a tunable peak response near 1060 nm with a full width at half maximum of 107 nm, which could be due to the combined effect of the narrow photo-current generation and the self-filtering effect of the silicon substrate. At zero bias, a specific detectivity of \sim 1\times 10 {11} Jones and linear dynamic range about 101 dB are achieved, in spite of the weak absorption of Si at this wavelength. The external quantum efficiency can be improved to 135 under a low bias of -1 V, indicating the existence of gain mechanism during photodetection. Finally, it is also found that the as-assembled near-infrared device shows excellent antiinterference capability during the photodetection process.

However, the existing recognition algorithms of malicious transaction behaviors only rely on traditional malicious features, resulting in low recognition efficiency. This paper proposes a novel technique for identifying collaborative malicious network behavior in e-commerce: the quantum behavior-based particle swarm optimization method with global search capability, which is combined with the rapidly converging k-means method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. The paper first illustrates that the current malicious network behavior is diversified and collaborative, it is necessary to identify malicious network behavior from a higher level-cooperation level, and then proposes original cooperative malicious behavior features of e-commerce. Second, the use of information transfer entropy (ITE) based on quantum potential energy is introduced to designate the node with the largest ITE in the cluster as the cluster center, avoiding randomly initializing cluster center nodes and calculating the distance repeatedly. Third, the existence of collaborative malicious network behavior and the feasibility of the algorithm are proved using the fixed point theorem in the probability metric space. Meanwhile, quantum behavior-based particle swarm optimization is used to extract cluster centers as a means of improving the spatial distribution and collaborative state of particle nodes, and enables the clustering algorithm to have global search ability.

(2020),2020,Athermal lithium niobate microresonator,Optics Express,"Lithium niobate (LN), possessing wide transparent window, strong electro-optic effect, and large optical nonlinearity, is an ideal material platform for integrated photonics application. Microring resonators are particularly suitable as integrated photonic components, given their flexibility of device engineering and their potential for large-scale integration. However, the susceptibility to temperature fluctuation has become a major challenge for their implementation in a practical environment. Here, we demonstrate an athermal LN microring resonator. By cladding an x-cut LN microring resonator with a thin layer of titanium oxide, we are able to completely eliminate the first-order thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) of cavity resonance right at room temperature (20°C), leaving only a small residual quadratic temperature dependence with a second-order TOC of only 0.37 pm/K2. It corresponds to a temperature-induced resonance wavelength shift within 0.33 nm over a large operating temperature range of (-10 – 50)°C that is one order of magnitude smaller than a bare LN microring resonator. Moreover, the TiO2-cladded LN microring resonator is able to preserve high optical quality, with an intrinsic optical Q of 5.8 × 105 that is only about 11% smaller than that of a bare LN resonator. The flexibility of thermo-optic engineering, high optical quality, and device fabrication compatibility show great promise of athermal LN/TiO2 hybrid devices for practical applications, elevating the potential importance of LN photonic integrated circuits for future communication, sensing, nonlinear and quantum photonics. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,10.1364/OE.398363,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089131805&doi=10.1364%2fOE.398363&partnerID=40&md5=9465a2e251635bd0d77c1eb1f513c61c,Article

The experimental exploration of endofullerene arrays comes at a time when machine learning techniques are rapidly being adopted to characterize, verify, and reconstruct quantum states from measurement data. In this paper, we develop a strategy for reconstructing the ground state of chains of dipolar rotors using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) adapted to train on data from higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate accurate generation of energy expectation values from an RBM trained on data in the free-rotor eigenstate basis and explore the learning resources required for various chain lengths and dipolar interaction strengths.

798,Scopus,Rodriguez et al. (2020),2020,Spatial density neural network force fields with first-principles level accuracy and application to thermal transport,Physical Review B,"Constrained by the fixed mathematical form of most empirical potentials used in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, many properties of materials cannot be captured within experimental accuracy. On the other hand, accurate electronic structure calculations based on quantum theory, most notably density functional theory (DFT), are limited to several hundred atoms within a picosecond, which makes the method inadequate for modeling systems beyond the nanoscale. A combination of speed from classical MD and fidelity from DFT can be achieved through machine learning methods. Herewith, we developed an approach named spatial density neural network force fields (SDNNFFs) by training neural networks to ""learn""and predict DFT-level forces. Our model focuses on the usage of a three-dimensional mesh of density functions, which together act as a mapping of the atomic environment and provides a physical representation of the forces acting on the central atom. Several notable advantages arise from the SDNNFF, including (1) the avoidance of the chain rule on the total energy and other variables by direct calculation of the forces from the neural network, (2) the ever large N×t scaling of the training data, where N is the number of atoms in a supercell and t is the number of evaluated structures by first-principles, and (3) the significant reduction in parameters and human effort needed to successfully train a force-and/or property-converged neural network force field. Overall, we focus on modeling DFT-level forces with minimal computational cost and parametrization for rapid prediction of phonon-based properties and future molecular dynamics of large-scale systems. To demonstrate the SDNNFF, we trained several models on diamond structures, including bulk silicon (Si), diamond, silicon carbide (SiC), and boron arsenide (BAs), and predicted their phonon dispersions and lattice thermal conductivities using the direct solution to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. For phonon properties, we utilized a fitting method for obtaining the second-and third-order force constants, which outperforms the highly force-sensitive finite displacement method when employing neural network force fields. In comparison to DFT lattice thermal conductivity, we obtained high precision results from our SDNNFF within 0.7% for Si, 6.2% for diamond, 2.76% for SiC, and 7.46% for BAs, with further agreement with experiments. The phonon dispersions from the SDNNFF also matched those from direct DFT and experiments. The developed approach for accurately predicting phonon transport properties of crystalline materials would largely benefit the design of advanced materials with improved performance, such as complex thermoelectric devices and low thermal resistance interfaces for nanoelectronics. Future applications of our SDNNFF model could be extended toward including atomic energy into the algorithm and simulating large-scale heterogeneous systems for quasielectronic representations for various properties. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035203,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088541166&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevB.102.035203&partnerID=40&md5=7e9a7d02d573ab7fa65de064c784a1bf,Article

The smallest possible molecular ensemble to address this challenge is a dual-molecule junction device, which has potential to unravel the effects of intermolecular crosstalk on electronic transport at the molecular level that cannot be elucidated using either conventional single-molecule or self-assembled monolayer (SAM) techniques. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) dual-molecule junction device, which utilizes noncovalent interactions and allows for direct comparison to the conventional STM single-molecule device. STM-break junction (BJ) measurements reveal a decrease in conductance of 10% per molecule from the dual-molecule to the single-molecule junction device. Quantum transport simulations indicate that this decrease is attributable to intermolecular crosstalk (i.e., intermolecular Ï-πinteractions), with possible contributions from substrate-mediated coupling (i.e., molecule-electrode). This study provides the first experimental evidence to interpret intermolecular crosstalk in electronic transport at the STM-BJ level and translates the experimental observations into meaningful molecular information to enhance our fundamental knowledge of this subject matter. This approach is pertinent to the design and development of future multimolecular electronic components and also to other dual-molecular systems where such crosstalk is mediated by various noncovalent intermolecular interactions (e.g., electrostatic and hydrogen bonding).

Therefore, in recent years, it has attracted wide attention from the academic circle and the industry. The purpose of this paper is to study the characteristics of single photon orbital angular momentum transfer based on information processing technology and to provide Suggestions for its technical optimization. Based on the characteristics of the angular momentum state of photon orbit, this paper studies its application and related problems in information processing and transmission. In this paper, quantum multiuser communication technology is studied, and a multiuser communication scheme based on photon orbital angular momentum state is proposed. The scheme takes advantage of the orthogonality of different orbital angular momentum states of the photon and assumes that the sender and receiver share a pair of entangled orbital angular momentum states. On this basis, the spatial light modulator is used to modulate it to the entangled photon of the sender, so that the sending photon carries all the user's information at the same time. Finally, the receiver accurately extracts the information of each sender by measuring the coincidence count and according to the specific receiving rules. Numerical simulation and experimental results show that the coincidence rate of different coding schemes is between 0 and 0.66, which proves the feasibility of the scheme. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,10.1088/1742-6596/1574/1/012117,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087917114&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1574%2f1%2f012117&partnerID=40&md5=9a3ef81cf4480213615f819f54dc02dc,Conference Paper

Traditionally, high-performance software is optimized by running experiments with sample data sets in order to profile and optimize expected behavior of workloads in practice. Since the (communication and computation) costs depend on the changing behavior of the symplectic invariant calculations, the standard optimization approach is insufficient.

With this work, an all on-chip silicon photonics based frequency synthesizer seems promising for mass production of next generation broad-band coherent optical communication systems, spectroscopic, detection, and ranging systems and future integrated quantum systems with Hz-level precision. © 2020 The Authors.

As important as they are likely to be, their implications are still little known. This article's purpose is an attempt to provide a policy space within which to begin fill that void. It presents a non-technical introduction to the concept of quantum mechanics in general, to the unique characteristics of sub-atomic particles, to quantum applications, and to QC and QAI in particular. The development of fully functioning quantum information technologies is in its early stages, but is being pursued aggressively. One of the most salient of these is Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) – a fusion of QC and AI – which some see as potentially threatening. There is little in established telecommunications or information policies to inform our approach to its capabilities. The article notes some of the challenges to development of quantum-based information technologies and considers the scope of global competition to the U.S. in this field, especially from China. It reviews the treatment of “Quantum Information Science” in U.S. policy. It describes the current policy environment and the range of new measures which might be available, if needed, to incorporate QAI into an overall information policy regime. In conclusion the article reviews the debate over adoption of the “precautionary principle” for QAI, an approach to policy when it must deal with weakly understood causes of potentially catastrophic or irreversible events. It sets out the arguments pro and con, and in the absence of an immediate resolution proposes adoption of a policy space in which stakeholders can address their salient concerns, without materially impairing technological progress and commercial viability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101909,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078033075&doi=10.1016%2fj.telpol.2020.101909&partnerID=40&md5=eb2b46d9f848419cbc7cefaf0a34e0e6,Article

It is known that additional interactions are present in 3-state molecular QCA that alter the required clocking fields needed for a device operation. Recent efforts in implementing logic gates using patterned dangling bonds (SiDBs) on hydrogen passivated silicon reveal significant challenges arising from similar effects. The necessary applied electrical potential needed to increase the population of an SiDB is strongly dependent on the current population of its neighbors, an effect we term congestion. It is unclear whether the strength of these interactions may pose an obstacle for future applications of SiDBs as a nanoscale QCA architecture. In this work, we investigate 3-state QCA in the regime in which congestion is significant and determine the extent to which such effects can be mitigated for SiDB devices. We propose that while SiDB-based QCA wires may be achievable depending on limitations of inter-dot tunneling, higher density devices such as majority gates may need to be replaced by more architecture specific implementations unless net-neutral variants of SiDB QCA devices can be demonstrated. © 2020 Author(s).",,10.1063/5.0007289,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087548412&doi=10.1063%2f5.0007289&partnerID=40&md5=642947cb289b8c1e833e18cefafbbd69,Article

(2020),2020,Saturnin: A suite of lightweight symmetric algorithms for post-quantum security,IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology,"The cryptographic algorithms needed to ensure the security of our communications have a cost. For devices with little computing power, whose number is expected to grow significantly with the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT), this cost can be a problem. A simple answer to this problem is a compromise on the security level: through a weaker round function or a smaller number of rounds, the security level can be decreased in order to cheapen the implementation of the cipher. At the same time, quantum computers are expected to disrupt the state of the art in cryptography in the near future. For public-key cryptography, the NIST has organized a dedicated process to standardize new algorithms. The impact of quantum computing is harder to assess in the symmetric case but its study is an active research area. In this paper, we specify a new block cipher, Saturnin, and its usage in different modes to provide hashing and authenticated encryption in such a way that we can rigorously argue its security in the post-quantum setting. Its security analysis follows naturally from that of the AES, while our use of components that are easily implemented in a bitsliced fashion ensures a low cost for our primitives. Our aim is to provide a new lightweight suite of algorithms that performs well on small devices, in particular micro-controllers, while providing a high security level even in the presence of quantum computers. Saturnin is a 256-bit block cipher with a 256-bit key and an additional 9-bit parameter for domain separation. Using it, we built two authenticated ciphers and a hash function. • Saturnin-CTR-Cascade is an authenticated cipher using the counter mode and a separate MAC. It requires two passes over the data but its implementation does not require the inverse block cipher. • Saturnin-Short is an authenticated cipher intended for messages with a length strictly smaller than 128 bits which uses only one call to Saturnin to provide confidentiality and integrity. • Saturnin-Hash is a 256-bit hash function. In this paper, we specify this suite of algorithms and argue about their security in both the classical and the post-quantum setting. © 2020, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum.

The need for gradient information in the training procedure of VQC applications has stimulated the development of auto-differentiation techniques for quantum circuits. We propose the first formalization of this technique, not only in the context of quantum circuits but also for imperative quantum programs (e.g., with controls), inspired by the success of differentiable programming languages in classical machine learning. In particular, we overcome a few unique difficulties caused by exotic quantum features (such as quantum no-cloning) and provide a rigorous formulation of differentiation applied to bounded-loop imperative quantum programs, its code-transformation rules, as well as a sound logic to reason about their correctness. Moreover, we have implemented our code transformation in OCaml and demonstrated the resource-efficiency of our scheme both analytically and empirically.

Thus, harvesting energy form radio frequency (RF) waves has become the most promising solution for providing the micropower needed for wireless sensor applications, especially in a widely distributed 4G/5G wireless network. However, the current research on rectenna is mainly focused on the integrated antenna coupled with metal-insulator-metal tunneling diodes.

Under the RF illumination, the generated current increases rapidly and the value can reach in the order of 10-8 10-7 A. The harvester can work under the multiple channel mode, harvesting energy simultaneously from different flows of wireless energy in the air.

(2020),2020,Quantum recurrent encoder–decoder neural network for performance trend prediction of rotating machinery,Knowledge-Based Systems,"Traditional neural networks generally neglect the primary and secondary relationships of input information and process the information indiscriminately, which leads to their bad nonlinear approximation capacity and low generalization ability. As a result, traditional neural networks always show poor prediction accuracy in the performance degradation trend prediction of rotating machinery (RM). In view of this, a novel neural network called quantum recurrent encoder–decoder neural network (QREDNN) is proposed in this paper. In QREDNN, the attention mechanism is used to simultaneously reconstruct encoder and decoder of QREDNN, so that QREDNN can fully excavate and pay attention to important information but suppress the interference of redundant information to obtain better nonlinear approximation capacity. On the other hand, the quantum neuron is used to construct a new quantum gated recurrent unit (QGRU) in which activation values and weights are represented by quantum rotation matrices. The QGRU can traverse the solution space more finely and has a lot of multiple attractors, so it can replace the traditional recurrent unit of the encoder and decoder and enhance the generalization ability and response speed of QREDNN. Moreover, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm is introduced to improve the update speeds of the rotation angles of quantum rotation matrices and the attention parameters of QREDNN. Based on the superiorities of QREDNN, a new performance trend prediction method for RM is proposed, in which the denoised fuzzy entropy (DFE) of vibration acceleration signal of RM is input into QREDNN as the performance degradation feature for predicting the performance degradation trend of RM. The examples of predicting the performance trend of rolling bearings demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105863,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083049451&doi=10.1016%2fj.knosys.2020.105863&partnerID=40&md5=b9b5cd29511d2f1000f94dc070231015,Article

In this Rapid Communication, we investigate the spin-momentum locking of the surface states of a wide range of monolayer transition metals (3d-TM) deposited on top of Bi2Se3 topological insulators using first-principles calculations. We find an anticorrelation between the magnetic moment of the 3d-TM and the magnitude of the spin-momentum locking induced by the Dirac surface states. While the magnetic moment is large in the first half of the 3d series, following Hund's rule, the spin-momentum locking is maximum in the second half of the series. We explain this trend as arising from a compromise between intra-atomic magnetic exchange and covalent bonding between the 3d-TM overlayer and the Dirac surface states. As a result, while Cr and Mn overlayers can be used successfully for the observation of the quantum anomalous Hall effect or the realization of axion insulators, Co and Ni are substantially more efficient for spin-charge conversion effects, e.g., spin-orbit torque and charge pumping. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevB.101.220410,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092223595&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevB.101.220410&partnerID=40&md5=d1e8e2be28a2d743b3e21c173a2645ae,Article

First principle calculations have been performed on pristine (undoped), center Li-doped, one-edge Li- terminated and both-edge Li-terminated AGNRs. Our calculations reveal that all the structures analyzed are thermodynamically stable. Based on transmission spectrum and standard two-probe setup based I-V characteristics of all the considered configurations, center Li-doped AGNRs are found to be the most suitable candidate for on-chip interconnect applications.

In this work, we concentrate on addressing the online multi-tenant provisioning (On-MTP) problem for QKD networks, where multiple tenant requests (TRs) arrive dynamically. On-MTP involves scheduling multiple TRs and assigning non-reusable secret keys derived from a QKD network to multiple TRs, where each TR can be regarded as a high-security-demand organization with the dedicated secret-key demand. The quantum key pools (QKPs) are constructed over QKD network infrastructure to improve management efficiency for secret keys. We model the secret-key resources for QKPs and the secret-key demands of TRs using distinct images. To realize efficient On-MTP, we perform a comparative study of heuristics and reinforcement learning (RL) based On-MTP solutions, where three heuristics (i.e., random, fit, and best-fit based On-MTP algorithms) are presented and a RL framework is introduced to realize automatic training of an On-MTP algorithm. The comparative results indicate that with sufficient training iterations the RL-based On-MTP algorithm significantly outperforms the presented heuristics in terms of tenant-request blocking probability and secret-key resource utilization. © 2019 IEEE.",,10.1109/TNSM.2020.2964003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086631951&doi=10.1109%2fTNSM.2020.2964003&partnerID=40&md5=b0e639397b7793a411260f1c28338938,Article

(2020),2020,High-speed and secure PRNG for cryptographic applications,International Journal of Computer Network and Information Security,"Due to the fundamentally different approach underlying quantum cryptography (QC), it has not only become competitive, but also has significant advantages over traditional cryptography methods. Such significant advantage as theoretical and informational stability is achieved through the use of unique quantum particles and the inviolability of quantum physics postulates, in addition it does not depend on the intruder computational capabilities. However, even with such impressive reliability results, QC methods have some disadvantages. For instance, such promising trend as quantum secure direct communication – eliminates the problem of key distribution, since it allows to transmit information by open channel without encrypting it. However, in these protocols, each bit is confidential and should not be compromised, therefore, the requirements for protocol stability are increasing and additional security methods are needed. For a whole class of methods to ensure qutrit QC protocols stability, reliable trit generation method is required. In this paper authors have developed and studied trit generation method and software tool TriGen v.2.0 PRNG.

In this article, we develop a simple and feasible concealed information test (CIT) method which is based on the audio-visual event-related potentials (ERPs) and its spatial and temporal features. The main purpose of this article is to extend a pattern recognition method with functional network parameters and global feature entropy of the EEG signals from the whole brain. At the same time, a novel quantum neural network (QNN) classifier was developed to distinguish the guilty and innocent conditions. Functional connectivity can provide extra information of interdependence between different brain regions from the spatial dimension, and entropy can reflect the complexity of the whole brain from the temporal dimension. 20 subjects participated in the CIT experiment and 30 channel ERPs were recorded. A high accuracy of 87.67% was got in recognizing the concealed information, which was higher than 85.43% for basic features, demonstrated the effectiveness of this article.

(2020),2020,Deep Q-learning decoder for depolarizing noise on the toric code,Physical Review Research,"We present an AI-based decoding agent for quantum error correction of depolarizing noise on the toric code. The agent is trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where an artificial neural network encodes the state-action Q values of error-correcting X, Y, and Z Pauli operations, occurring with probabilities px, py, and pz, respectively. By learning to take advantage of the correlations between bit-flip and phase-flip errors, the decoder outperforms the minimum-weight-perfect-matching algorithm, achieving higher success rate and higher error threshold for depolarizing noise (pz=px=py), for code distances d≤9. The decoder trained on depolarizing noise also has close to optimal performance for uncorrelated noise and provides functional but suboptimal decoding for biased noise (pz≠px=py). We argue that the DRL-type decoder provides a promising framework for future practical error correction of topological codes, striking a balance between on-the-fly calculations, in the form of forward evaluation of a deep Q network, and pretraining and information storage.

In general, very small changes in optical or vibrational properties were observed compared to pristine samples, suggesting noteworthy stability even for high dosages of gamma radiation. Moreover, we found that WSe2 monolayer samples exhibited higher tolerance to gamma radiation compared to WS2 samples.

(2020),2020,Narrowband Polaritonic Thermal Emitters Driven by Waste Heat,ACS Omega,"There are a broad range of applications for narrowband long-wave infrared (LWIR) sources, especially within the 8-12 μm atmospheric window. These include infrared beacons, free-space communications, spectroscopy, and potentially on-chip photonics. Unfortunately, commercial light-emitting diode (LED) sources are not available within the LWIR, leaving only gas-phase and quantum cascade lasers, which exhibit low wall-plug efficiencies and in many cases require large footprints, precluding their use for many applications. Recent advances in nanophotonics have demonstrated the potential for tailoring thermal emission into an LED-like response, featuring narrowband, polarized thermal emitters. In this work, we demonstrate that such nanophotonic IR emitting metamaterials (NIREMs), featuring near-unity absorption, can serve as LWIR sources with effectively no net power consumption, enabling their operation entirely by waste heat from conventional electronics. Using experimental emissivity spectra from a SiC NIREM device in concert with a thermodynamic compact model, we verify this feasibility for two test cases: a NIREM device driven by waste heat from a CPU heat sink and one operating using a low-power resistive heater for elevated temperature operation. To validate these calculations, we experimentally determine the temperature-dependent NIREM irradiance and the angular radiation pattern. We purport that these results provide a first proof-of-concept for waste heat-driven thermal emitters potentially employable in a variety of infrared application spaces. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acsomega.0c00600,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084665570&doi=10.1021%2facsomega.0c00600&partnerID=40&md5=64bb926ff7c078facd2ade3553368aa1,Article

(2020),2020,Architecting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Trapped Ion Quantum Computers,Proceedings - International Symposium on Computer Architecture,"Trapped ions (TI) are a leading candidate for building Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including high qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubit TI devices, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD-based TI systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive application-driven architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. To enable our study, we built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.

One of their appealing functionalities is that, after they have learned a probability distribution from a dataset, they allow exact and efficient sampling of typical system configurations. Here we employ a neural autoregressive distribution estimator (NADE) to boost Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of a paradigmatic classical model of spin-glass theory, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian. We show that a NADE can be trained to accurately mimic the Boltzmann distribution using unsupervised learning from system configurations generated using standard MCMC algorithms. The trained NADE is then employed as smart proposal distribution for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This allows us to perform efficient MCMC simulations, which provide unbiased results even if the expectation value corresponding to the probability distribution learned by the NADE is not exact. Notably, we implement a sequential tempering procedure, whereby a NADE trained at a higher temperature is iteratively employed as proposal distribution in a MCMC simulation run at a slightly lower temperature. This allows one to efficiently simulate the spin-glass model even in the low-temperature regime, avoiding the divergent correlation times that plague MCMC simulations driven by local-update algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the NADE-driven simulations quickly sample ground-state configurations, paving the way to their future utilization to tackle binary optimization problems. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053312,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086302602&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevE.101.053312&partnerID=40&md5=a3b3e6371c92a99211d368eabf6b73be,Article

Under the sole assumptions of a Gaussian environment and regardless of the system coupled to it, an algorithm to determine the parameters of an equivalent set of interacting damped oscillators obeying a Markovian quantum master equation is introduced. By choosing a suitable coupling to the system and minimizing an appropriate distance between the two-time correlation function of this effective bath and that of the target environment, the error induced in the reduced dynamics of the system is brought under rigorous control. The interactions among the effective modes provide remarkable flexibility in replicating non-Markovian effects on the system even with a small number of oscillators, and the resulting Lindblad equation for the system and the modes may therefore be integrated at a very reasonable computational cost using standard methods for Markovian problems, even in strongly nonperturbative coupling regimes and at arbitrary temperatures including zero. We apply the method to an exactly solvable problem in order to demonstrate its accuracy, and present two studies based on current research in the context of coherent transport in biological aggregates and organic photovoltaics as more realistic examples of its use and potential; performance and versatility are highlighted, and theoretical and numerical advantages over existing methods, as well as possible future improvements, are discussed. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.101.052108,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085842557&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.101.052108&partnerID=40&md5=4874d0191275383dd217489a0f07a85c,Article

In this work, we report on two experiments that use the non-local properties of entanglement to teleport quantum states: three-photon state teleportation and four-photon entanglement teleportation. We discuss all the experimental results in light of a theoretical model that we develop to account for the non-idealities of the quantum source. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables a deep understanding of how each parameter of the source affects the teleportation fidelities and it pinpoints the requirements needed to overcome the classical limits. Finally, our model suggests how to further improve quantum-dot entangled-photon sources for practical quantum networks. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/JSTQE.2020.2985285,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085660216&doi=10.1109%2fJSTQE.2020.2985285&partnerID=40&md5=773cca80be4559f9886f0a81f53bb48a,Article

Here, we present a consistent set of highly accurate rovibronic (rotation-vibration-electronic) energy levels for the five lowest electronic states (X 2 Σ +, _Rfaut2 Π, B2 Σ +, C2 Δ, and D2 Σ+) of CaOH. A comprehensive analysis of the published spectroscopic literature on this system has allowed 1955 energy levels to be determined from 3204 rovibronic experimental transitions, all with unique quantum number labeling and measurement uncertainties. The data set covers rotational excitation up to J = 62.5 for molecular states below 29,000 cm-1. The analysis was performed using the Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels algorithm, which is a robust procedure based on the theory of spectroscopic networks.

To prevent steganography from being misused, the scheme of detection of least significant bit steganography in quantum images based on novel enhanced quantum representation of digital images is proposed. In this scheme, the quantum image is partitioning in pixel blocks at first. Then, according to how the value of the discrimination function f changes under the flipping function F, the pixel block can be divided into three types of groups that are regular group, singular group and unusable group, respectively. The number of regular and singular groups is used to determine whether the image is embedded with secret message and calculate the length (in percent of pixels) of secret message. A series of reversible logic circuits are designed to implement the scheme with the circuit complexity of O (q2) , where q is the number of qubits to represent gray scale.

(2020),2020,Superstable copper nanowire network electrodes by single-crystal graphene covering and their applications in flexible nanogenerator and light-emitting diode,Nano Energy,"Copper nanowires (CuNWs), with excellent electronic properties and high cost-effectiveness, have tremendous potential in the field of transparent conductive electrodes for flexible electronics, large touch screen display and triboelectric energy harvesters, while their vulnerability to oxidation in air has impeded possible practical applications. Fortunately, it has been recognized that graphene encapsulation of CuNWs is capable of protecting CuNWs. However, neither self-assembled reduced graphene oxide nor chemical vapor deposition-grown polycrystalline graphene coatings can guarantee full protection to CuNWs, due to their ubiquitous voids, grain boundaries and wrinkles that allow water and oxygen molecules to pass through and result in the accelerated electrochemical corrosion at the graphene-copper interface, especially under folding conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a sandwich-structured single-crystal graphene/copper nanowire network/UV-curable resin (SCG/CuNW/UVR) composite film with ultrahigh electronic performance stability. The SCG/CuNW/UVR electrode exhibits a good optical and electrical performance (~19 Ω sq−1 under 84.3% transmittance), excellent mechanical robust and remarkably high oxidation resistance (ΔR/R0 &lt; 0.2 within 180 days), in sharp contrast with the bare CuNWs (ΔR/R0 &gt; 1 after 1 day) and polycrystalline graphene-covered CuNWs counterparts (ΔR/R0 &gt; 1 after 7 days). Furthermore, the SCG/CuNW/UVR electrodes can replace indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to construct the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) and quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLED), comparable to the flexible commercial ITO counterparts. The fabrication of such high-performance SCG/CuNW/UVR electrode is facile to be scaled-up with low cost, providing the feasibility for industrial applications of flexible ITO-free electronic and optoelectronic devices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104638,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080028626&doi=10.1016%2fj.nanoen.2020.104638&partnerID=40&md5=cbdb5c2a30bcf03bab479b7adf34c9cf,Article

Building quantum networks requires scalable quantum light–matter interfaces1 based on atoms3, ions4 or other optically addressable qubits. Solid-state emitters5, such as quantum dots and defects in diamond or silicon carbide6–10, have emerged as promising candidates for such interfaces. So far, it has not been possible to scale up these systems, motivating the development of alternative platforms. A central challenge is identifying emitters that exhibit coherent optical and spin transitions while coupled to photonic cavities that enhance the light–matter interaction and channel emission into optical fibres. Rare-earth ions in crystals are known to have highly coherent 4f–4f optical and spin transitions suited to quantum storage and transduction11–15, but only recently have single rare-earth ions been isolated16,17 and coupled to nanocavities18,19. The crucial next steps towards using single rare-earth ions for quantum networks are realizing long spin coherence and single-shot readout in photonic resonators. Here we demonstrate spin initialization, coherent optical and spin manipulation, and high-fidelity single-shot optical readout of the hyperfine spin state of single 171Yb3+ ions coupled to a nanophotonic cavity fabricated in an yttrium orthovanadate host crystal. These ions have optical and spin transitions that are first-order insensitive to magnetic field fluctuations, enabling optical linewidths of less than one megahertz and spin coherence times exceeding thirty milliseconds for cavity-coupled ions, even at temperatures greater than one kelvin. The cavity-enhanced optical emission rate facilitates efficient spin initialization and single-shot readout with conditional fidelity greater than 95 per cent.

Here, we report the first three-dimensional potential energy surfaces for the lowest three singlet states for HOBr, based on high level multi reference configuration interaction calculations. Quantum dynamics calculations are performed with a real wavepacket method, yielding not only absorption spectra but also internal state and angular distributions of the photodissociation fragments. Our results agree quantitatively with the measured total absorption cross sections of HOBr in the ultraviolet region and reproduce well the observed vibrationally cold and rotationally hot OH/OD fragments via photodissociation of HOBr/DOBr at 266 nm. In addition, we predict that the recoil anisotropy parameters for OH/OD are close to the limiting value of a parallel transition, suggesting a rapid dissociation process at 266 nm following an in-plane transition from the ground state (11A′) to the 21A′ state.

(2020),2020,Pseudo-2D superconducting quantum computing circuit for the surface code: Proposal and preliminary tests,New Journal of Physics,"Among the major hardware platforms for large-scale quantum computing, one of the leading candidates is superconducting quantum circuits. Current proposed architectures for quantum error-correction with the promising surface code require a two-dimensional layout of superconducting qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. A major hurdle for the scalability in such an architecture using superconducting systems is the so-called wiring problem, where qubits internal to a chipset become difficult to access by the external control/readout lines. In contrast to the existing approaches which address the problem through intricate three-dimensional wiring and packaging technology, leading to a significant engineering challenge, here we address this problem by presenting a modified microarchitecture in which all the wiring can be realized through a newly introduced pseudo two-dimensional resonator network which provides the inter-qubit connections via airbridges. Our proposal is completely compatible with current standard planar circuit technology. We carried out experiments to examine the feasibility of the new airbridge component. The measured quality factor of the airbridged resonator is below the simulated surface-code threshold required for a coupling resonator, and it should not limit simulated gate fidelity. The measured crosstalk between crossed resonators is at most-49 dB in resonance. Further spatial and frequency separation between the resonators should result in relatively limited crosstalk between them, which would not increase as the size of the chipset increases. This architecture and the preliminary tests indicate the possibility that a large-scale, fully error-corrected quantum computer could be constructed by monolithic integration technologies without additional overhead or special packaging know-how. © 2020 The Author(s).

Crystalline thin films are particularly attractive for such resonators due to their prospects for high quality, high intrinsic stress, high yield strength, and low dissipation. However, when such films are grown on a silicon substrate, interfacial defects arising from lattice mismatch with the substrate have been postulated to introduce additional dissipation. Here, we develop a back-side etching process for single-crystal silicon carbide microresonators that allows us to quantitatively verify this prediction. By engineering the geometry of the resonators and removing the defective interfacial layer, we achieve quality factors exceeding a million in silicon carbide trampoline resonators at room temperature, a factor of five higher than those achieved without removal of the interfacial defect layer.

The transition between nonvolatile resistive switching and volatile TS modes can be realized by doping, varying annealing and voltage sweeping conditions, or imposing different compliance current. Here, a strategy is reported to achieve such transition by the noninvasive UV light stimulus based on InP/ZnS quantum dot (QD) memristor. The core–shell InP/ZnS QDs with quasi-type II band alignment ensures photoexcited electrons localized in InP core, photoexcited hole state distributed in the outer shell, and subsequent lifetime controlling of conductive filament under light irradiation. Systematic mechanism investigations indicate that UV photogenerated holes are accumulated on the surface of the QD film, which is consistent with rapid transfer of photogenerated holes in the core–shell InP/ZnS structure.

However, challenging issues including water-sensitive feature, poor stability over temperature change and mechanical fragility should be circumvented to enable the practical uses of such nanocrystals. Ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) rubber, which possesses saturated and nonpolar polymeric chain, has been extensively explored in industry due to its sealing property, low-cost, dynamic and outstanding abrasive resistance. In this study, the hybrid inorganic-organic network with covalent cross-linkages and CsPbX3 (X = Cl and Br) quantum dots has been established in EPDM rubber system via an effective and mild approach in the process of mixing reaction at room temperature. In contrast to pure perovskite dots, the peak emission intensity of CsPb(Cl0·25Br0.75)3-EPDM can be well maintained after it has been immersed into aqueous solution for 2 h. Moreover, the water-mediated treatment will control the emission color evolution from cyan (485 nm) to green (510 nm) and such process can be fully reversible during the soaking and drying cycles. In addition, the employment of such polymeric host with superior heat resistance results in significant increases in thermal stability, mechanical strength and toughness. This efficient strategy will provide a rational design of reinforcing photoluminescence for all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots in numerous applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152693,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073994789&doi=10.1016%2fj.jallcom.2019.152693&partnerID=40&md5=3ca21d89ebf54064de897998e5ae4ee2,Article

Conventional attempts to utilize magnetic doping, mechanical tuning, structural engineering, external bias, and external magnetic fields suffer from a lack of reversible switching and have limited tunability. We demonstrate the direct control of topological phases in a bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) topological insulator in 3 nm molecular beam epitaxy-grown films through the hybridization of the topological surface states with the hafnium (Hf) d-orbitals in the topmost layer of an underlying oxygen-deficient hafnium oxide (HfO2) substrate. The higher angular momentum of the d-orbitals of Hf is hybridized strongly by topological insulators, thereby enhancing the spin-orbit coupling and perturbing the topological surface states asymmetry in Bi2Se3. As the oxygen defect is cured or generated reversibly by external electric fields, our research facilitates the complete electrical control of the topological phases of topological insulators by controlling the defect density in the adjacent transition metal oxide. In addition, this mechanism can be applied in other related topological materials such as Weyl and Dirac semimetals in future endeavors to facilitate practical applications in unit-element devices for quantum computing and quantum communication.

The model utilizes a uniformly connected nodal structure, where the connections are discretely adaptive and the nodes act as simple gatekeepers. The model replicates all known logics used in current electronics, such as AND, OR, XNOR, XOR, NOR, XNOR, NAND and NOT. Additionally, by using recurrent negating connections the model easily creates XOR gates, and adds novel sided and favoured gates. This model also facilitates the creation of ternary to n-ary gates, and it simplifies the creation of a number of majority functions (especially for an odd number of inputs). Also, as a multi-layered neural network, the model allows learning back propagation through the use of its negating connections. Finally, because of its adaptive connections, parts of the network can be used as internal memory. Overall, the model provides backward compatibility to existing CMOS circuitry, while opening up a number of new logics and architectures for neural computing. © 2019",,10.1016/j.neucom.2019.10.099,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076001333&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2019.10.099&partnerID=40&md5=e68112b53f451f39f954f4cbb0be03f3,Article

Generally, its generation requires complex beam splitting processes which limit scalability. A promising trend is to integrate multiple nonlinear processes into a single device via frequency or time multiplexing. The generated states in these schemes are useful for quantum computation. However, they are confined in one or two beams and hard to be spatially separated for applications in quantum communication. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scheme to generate spatially separated hexapartite entangled states by means of spatially multiplexing seven concurrent four-wave mixing processes. In addition, we show that the entanglement structure characterized by subsystem entanglement distribution can be modified by appropriately shaping the pump characteristics.

This task requires the design of new secret coding schemes, which can be also based on multiple-valued logic (MVL). However, this very specific logic model reveals new possibilities for the hierarchical data clustering of arbitrary data sets. The minimization of multiple-valued logic functions is proposed for the analysis of aggregated objects, which is possible for an arbitrary number of variables. In order to use all the useful properties of the multiple-valued logic, the heterogeneous network architecture is proposed, which includes three allocated levels of artificial intelligence (AI) logic modeling for discrete multiple-valued logic, Boolean logic, and fuzzy logic. Multiple-valued logic is regarded as the possible platform for additional secret coding, data aggregation, and communications, which are provided by the united high dimensional space for network addressing and the targeted control of robotic devices.

However, lately, the threat from a future quantum computer has prompted successors resilient to quantum computer-based attacks. Here, an algorithm similar to Diffie–Hellman is presented. In contrast to the classic Diffie–Hellman, it involves floating point numbers of arbitrary size in the generation of a shared secret. This can, in turn, be used for encrypted communication based on symmetric cyphers. The validity of the algorithm is verified by proving that a vital part of the algorithm satisfies a one-way property. The decimal part is deployed for the one-way function in a way that makes the protocol a post-quantum key generation procedure. This is concluded from the fact that there is, as of yet, no quantum computer algorithm reverse engineering the one-way function. An example illustrating the use of the protocol in combination with XOR encryption is given. © 2020 by the author.

869,Scopus,Domb & Leshem (2020),2020,Secured key distribution by concatenating optical communications and inter-device hand-held video transmission,Applied System Innovation,"Key distribution is a growing concern for symmetric cryptography. Most of the current key-distribution mechanisms assume the use of the Internet and WAN networks, which are exposed to security hazards. To overcome them, the use of comprehensive and robust cryptographic mechanisms such as Diffie–Hellman (DH) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithms are proposed. These solutions are limited. DH and RSA have been under threat since the introduction of quantum computing. Hence, new ideas are required. This paper introduces a new security approach for a safe key transmission using undetected high-speed optical camera communication (OCC), which is based on the rolling shutter effect of modern smart cameras. The key transfer is done by blinking light-emitting diode (LED) lights in a specific sequence and frequency, following an encoding pattern. The receiver decodes the received blinks to a bit string using a corresponding image processing application. This optical media ensures secure transfer without the ability to quote it. We demonstrate in an experiment the feasibility of using basic wireless optical communication for key transmission, eliminating the need for a permanent, long, and costly setup. It is mobile, available everywhere anytime, and requires only simple connections to operate. The results show that this method is feasible, robust, efficient, and implementable. © 2020 by the authors.

Nowadays, QKD integrated in backbone, metro, and access areas has been respectively studied and tested around the world. Although the experiments in various scenarios can verify the feasibility of QKD, the situation of QKD between two end users from metro to access networks has not been considered up to now. In this paper, we propose a QKD Network (QKDN) architecture for end-to-end QKD from metro to access networks in a costefficient manner. The cost efficiency can be achieved by sharing Quantum Receivers (Qrecs) in the metro network with the Quantum Transmitters (Qtras) in various access networks since the distance between any two end users within a metro network permits to distribute quantum keys. Under such an architecture, an end-to-end QKD scheme is designed to provide secret keys for end users in different access networks, by mapping Qrecs and allocating time slots according to security requests. Through the end-to-end QKD scheme, the occupation of Qrecs and time slots can be appropriately improved. To verify the effectiveness of the scheme, simulation is conducted on two different topologies respectively. Performances are evaluated in terms of three parameters: i) the failure ratio of end-to-end QKD (FQ), ii) the utilization ratio of time slots (TU), and iii) the utilization ratio of Qrecs (QU). Simulation results show that the topology with more nodes will lower the QU by distributing requests to more numbers of Qrecs. Moreover, the topology with bigger node connectivity can lower FQ since a shorter path will be selected to save the unnecessary occupation of link resources for other end-to-end requests. © 2020 IEEE.",,10.1109/DRCN48652.2020.1570611062,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085519606&doi=10.1109%2fDRCN48652.2020.1570611062&partnerID=40&md5=72910ef8a8b97ae5ceeb024e28bfe97e,Conference Paper

The distance that quantum communication schemes can cover via direct communication is fundamentally limited by losses on the communication channel. By means of quantum repeaters, the reach of these schemes can be extended and chains of quantum repeaters could in principle cover arbitrarily long distances. In this work, we provide two efficient algorithms for determining the generation time and fidelity of the first generated entangled pair between the end nodes of a quantum repeater chain. The runtime of the algorithms increases polynomially with the number of segments of the chain, which improves upon the exponential runtime of existing algorithms. Our first algorithm is probabilistic and can analyze refined versions of repeater chain protocols which include intermediate entanglement distillation. Our second algorithm computes the waiting time distribution up to a pre-specified truncation time, has faster runtime than the first one and is moreover exact up to machine precision. Using our proof-of-principle implementation, we are able to analyze repeater chains of thousands of segments for some parameter regimes. The algorithms thus serve as useful tools for the analysis of large quantum repeater chain protocols and topologies of the future quantum internet. © 2020 IEEE.",,10.1109/JSAC.2020.2969037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078812569&doi=10.1109%2fJSAC.2020.2969037&partnerID=40&md5=7409f83bddd070ff4941e665f1108cfa,Article

Our numerical results of the ground-state energies with up to 16 layers of DNNs show excellent agreement with the Bethe ansatz exact solution. Furthermore, we also calculate the loop correlation function using the wave function obtained. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying DNNs to numerical quantum many-body calculations. © 2020 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

Type-II In(Ga)Sb quantum dots grown in InAs matrices have the potential to serve as a viable material system for wavelength-flexible, mid-infrared sources. Here, we dramatically expand the range of potential applications of these mid-infrared quantum emitters through the demonstration of surface-emitting electrically pumped mid-infrared light-emitting diodes with active regions utilizing type-II In(Ga)Sb quantum dots. Two device structures were studied, the first iteration being a single In(Ga)Sb insertion layer within a simple PIN structure and the second being a design engineered for improved room temperature emission with the addition of lattice matched AlAsSb cladding at the anode to block electrons and five layers of In(Ga)Sb dots to increase the effective volume of active material.

(2020),2020,Self-Organized Synchronization of Phonon Lasers,Physical Review Letters,"Self-organized synchronization is a ubiquitous collective phenomenon, in which each unit adjusts their rhythms to achieve synchrony through mutual interactions. The optomechanical systems, due to their inherently engineerable nonlinearities, provide an ideal platform to study self-organized synchronization. Here, we demonstrate the self-organized synchronization of phonon lasers in a two-membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system. The probe of each individual membrane enables us to monitor the real-time transient dynamics of synchronization, which reveals that the system enters into the synchronization regime via a torus birth bifurcation line. The phase-locking phenomenon and the transition between in-phase and antiphase regimes are directly observed. Moreover, such a system greatly facilitates the controllable synchronous states, and consequently a phononic memory is realized by tuning the system parameters. This result is an important step towards the future studies of many-body collective behaviors in multiresonator optomechanics with long distances, and might find potential applications in quantum information processing and complex networks. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.053604,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079742172&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevLett.124.053604&partnerID=40&md5=4372395c8e5a7c9eee4767dec7eaf436,Article
885,Scopus,Dubosq et al. (2020),2020,Quantum modeling of the optical spectra of carbon cluster structural families and relation to the interstellar extinction UV bump,Astronomy and Astrophysics,"Context. The UV bump observed in the interstellar medium extinction curve of galaxies has been assigned to π → π⋆ transitions within the sp2 conjugated network of carbon grains. These grains are commonly thought to be graphitic particles or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, questions are still open regarding the shape and degree of amorphization of these particles, which could account for the variations in the 2175 Å astronomical bump. Optical spectra of graphitic and onion-like carbon structures were previously obtained from dielectric constant calculations based on oscillating dipole models. In the present study, we compute the optical spectra of entire populations of carbon clusters using an explicit quantum description of their electronic structure for each individual isomer. Aims. Our aim is to determine the optical spectra of pure carbon clusters Cn=24,42,60 sorted into structural populations according to specific order parameters, namely asphericity and sp2 fraction, and to correlate these order parameters to the spectral features of the band in the region of the UV bump. Our comparison involves data measured for the astronomical UV bump as well as experimental spectra of carbon species formed in laboratory flames. Methods. The individual spectrum of each isomer is determined using the time-dependent density functional tight-binding method. The final spectrum for a given population is obtained by averaging the individual spectra for all isomers of a given family. Our method allows for an explicit description of particle shape, as well as structural and electronic disorder with respect to purely graphitic structures. Results. The spectra of the four main populations of cages, flakes, pretzels, and branched structures (Dubosq et al. 2019, A&A, 625, L11) all display strong absorption in the 2-8 eV domain, mainly due to π → π* transitions. The absorption features, however, differ from one family to another and our quantum modeling indicates that the best candidates for the interstellar UV bump at 217.5 nm are cages and then flakes, while the opposite trend is found for the carbonaceous species formed in flame experiments; the other two families of pretzels and branched structures play a lesser role in both cases. Conclusions. Our quantum modeling shows the potential contribution of carbon clusters with a high fraction of conjugated sp2 atoms to the astronomical UV bump and to the spectrum of carbonaceous species formed in flames. While astronomical spectra are better accounted for using rather spherical isomers such as cages, planar flake structures are involved as a much greater component in flame experiments. Interestingly, these flake isomers have been proposed as likely intermediates in the formation mechanisms leading to buckminsterfullerene, which was recently detected in space. This study, although restricted here to the case of pure carbon clusters, will be extended towards several directions of astronomical relevance. In particular, the ability of the present approach to deal with large-scale molecular systems at an explicit quantum level of electronic structure and its transferable character towards different charge states and the possible presence of heteroatoms makes it the method of choice to address the important case of neutral and ionic hydrogenated compounds. © C.

In particular, the W state has attracted a lot of attention due to the robustness against particle loss and the applications in multiparty quantum communication. However, it is challenging to generate a photonic W state with a large number of photons, since the N-photon W state requires superposition among N probability amplitudes. In this paper, we propose an efficient linear optical scheme to generate N-photon W states via quantum erasure. The success probability of our protocol polynomially decreases as the number of photons increases. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of our protocol and anticipate that one can efficiently generate tens of photonic W states with our scheme using currently available quantum photonics technologies. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.101.022337,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082794776&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.101.022337&partnerID=40&md5=db1402b67fa7bc4a632bc53ab8e17048,Article

By means of a combination of the time-dependent variational principle and a tree-tensor network, we characterize the current flowing during annealing in a ring-shaped one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with artificial classical gauge field on up to 32 lattice sites. We find that the superfluid current shows, after an initial decrease, persistent oscillations which survive even when the system is well inside the Mott insulating phase. We demonstrate that the amplitude of such oscillations is connected to the residual energy, characterizing the creation of defects while crossing the quantum critical point, while their frequency matches the spectral gap in the Mott insulating phase. Our predictions can be verified in future atomtronics experiments with neutral atoms in ring-shaped traps.

By exchanging the random control parameters that correspond to different feedback delays of local external-cavity semiconductor lasers, the legitimate users Alice and Bob can identify the time slots in which high-quality private chaos synchronization is achieved. Based on this property, a true random seed key can be independently and privately generated by Alice and Bob, in virtue of symmetric post-processing. Moreover, an ASA is designed to generate a new high-rate key as the final key. By the ASA iterations, random final key distribution with an extended rate significantly higher than that of the seed key can be achieved.

Specifically, a comprehensive quantum algorithm for encoding the estimated signal into a quantum state is presented, synthesizing the subroutines of state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, phase estimation and so on. Indispensable assumptions along with the quantum algorithm are summarized and assumption testing in a MIMO scenario is conducted. Both theoretical analyses from the mathematical point of view and simulated realizations in massive MIMO systems basically confirm the applicability of the quantum algorithm. With desired precision, the quantum algorithm achieves almost quadratic speedup over all classical counterparts.

To gain such optimal parameters, traditional search algorithms are performed quite frequently despite the high time and hardware overhead, which may be a severe challenge for real-time QKD systems and large-scale QKD networks.

We use SEMNET to predict future trends in research and to inspire personalized and surprising seeds of ideas in science.

In SEMNET, scientific knowledge is represented as an evolving network using the content of 750,000 scientific papers published since 1919. The nodes of the network correspond to physical concepts, and links between two nodes are drawn when two concepts are concurrently studied in research articles. We identify influential and prize-winning research topics from the past inside SEMNET, thus confirming that it stores useful semantic knowledge. We train a neural network using states of SEMNET of the past to predict future developments in quantum physics and confirm high-quality predictions using historic data.

However, the scalability of BP thin film is still a challenge, and its poor stability in the air has hampered the progress of the commercialization of BP devices. Herein, we report the use of hydrothermal-synthesized and air-stable 2D tellurene nanoflakes for broadband and ultrasensitive photodetection. The tellurene nanoflakes show high hole mobilities up to 458 cm2/V·s at ambient conditions, and the tellurene photodetector presents peak extrinsic responsivity of 383 A/W, 19.2 mA/W, and 18.9 mA/W at 520 nm, 1.55 μm, and 3.39 μm light wavelength, respectively.

However, the bottle-neck problems encountered by quantum key distribution network, such as concurrent conflict of large-scale quantum relay links, relay delay and inconvenient access to applications, are still not solved completely.

(2020),2020,Elucidating Energy Pathways through Simultaneous Measurement of Absorption and Transmission in a Coupled Plasmonic-Photonic Cavity,Nano Letters,"Control of light-matter interactions is central to numerous advances in quantum communication, information, and sensing. The relative ease with which interactions can be tailored in coupled plasmonic-photonic systems makes them ideal candidates for investigation. To exert control over the interaction between photons and plasmons, it is essential to identify the underlying energy pathways which influence the system's dynamics and determine the critical system parameters, such as the coupling strength and dissipation rates. However, in coupled systems which dissipate energy through multiple competing pathways, simultaneously resolving all parameters from a single experiment is challenging as typical observables such as absorption and scattering each probe only a particular path. In this work, we simultaneously measure both photothermal absorption and two-sided optical transmission in a coupled plasmonic-photonic resonator consisting of plasmonic gold nanorods deposited on a toroidal whispering-gallery-mode optical microresonator. We then present an analytical model which predicts and explains the distinct line shapes observed and quantifies the contribution of each system parameter. By combining this model with experiment, we extract all system parameters with a dynamic range spanning 9 orders of magnitude. Our combined approach provides a full description of plasmonic-photonic energy dynamics in a weakly coupled optical system, a necessary step for future applications that rely on tunability of dissipation and coupling.

The first step towards ensuring security is to securely authenticate all the computational nodes through use of authentication protocols based on public-key cryptography. But, traditional public-key cryptographic primitives we use today are believed to be breakable by large scale quantum computers of the future. Thus, NIST is currently running a global global level standardization process for quantum-resistant public-key cryptography, better known as post-quantum cryptography.

907,Scopus,Wu (2020),2020,The Principle of Cyberspace Mimic Defense,Wireless Networks(United Kingdom),"As pointed out in the previous chapters, cyberspace mimic defense (CMD) is technically based on an innovative general robust control structure (GRCS) and a deceptive mimic camouflage or invisibility/stealth mechanism that can produce a physical or logical scenario similar to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, and this structure and mechanism can be employed to provide the intensified “trinity” functionality: application service provision, reliability guarantee, and secure and trusted defense in the target object. Its GRCS and endogenous security mechanism can provide Integrated Point-Surface (IPS) suppression without relying on prior knowledge of the attacker and conventional active/passive protection and control measures against uncertain threats based on unknown vulnerabilities or virus Trojans within the target system. Physical or virtual software/hardware bodies or virtual physical combined bodies designed based on this control structure and camouflage mechanism, such as IP cores, chips, middleware/embedded hardware and software, modules, components, devices, systems, platforms or networks, as well as all kinds of virtualization processing scenarios, can effectively control general uncertain disturbances (GUD), including known unknown security risks or unknown unknown security threats. However, CMD aims to solve the deal with uncertain threats from target-unknown vulnerabilities and cannot and will never completely solve all security-related problems in cyberspace, nor does it attempt to independently support the entire protection and control system for cyber security or hinder the inheritance or adoption of the relevant technological achievements and emerging technologies in future. As the world faces a conundrum of unsecured credibility of supply chains at the component layer, CMD only seeks to solve it in the uncertain operational scenarios taking shape on the basis of an innovative GRCS and a mimic camouflage mechanism (MCM),at the software/hardware structural level, and against the background of fully open ecology characterized by national division of labor, industrial division of labor, or even intro-product division of labor; also, it tends to change the current “cyber game rules” by turning over the cyber-attack theories and methods based on software/hardware code design vulnerabilities; promote major innovations in cyber defense theories, game rival models, and technical means and methods; reverse the strategic pattern of seriously imbalanced attack-defense postures; reshape the new cyber security order in the information age; and develop a new generation of information technology and industry featuring endogenous security functionality.

For stable molecules, infrared spectra of methane at high resolution, propene, CH3OH and CH3F with internal rotation, molecular complexes with ortho-H2, and ultraviolet spectra of NO are discussed. The diminished cage effect allows the preparation of free radicals from photolysis in situ, either directly or via bimolecular reactions, such as Cl + unsaturated hydrocarbons to form radical products. Another novel method is the production of protonated and hydrogenated species on electron bombardment during deposition at 3.2 K. We have applied this method to small molecules (e.g., OCS), proton-bound dimers (e.g., N2-H+-N2) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that might be the carriers of unidentified infrared bands in astronomy. Hydrogen addition and abstraction reactions are also studied with photolytically produced H atoms from Cl + H2 (v = 1); several reactions with nitrogen-containing molecules (e.g., HONO and formamide) revealed reaction networks that are important for chemical evolution in space.

Recently, scientists raise a plan of developing a satellite for more challenging objectives, including all-day quantum communication over 10000 km, quantum entanglement distribution with two ground stations over 10000km and several space quantum experiment. The ambitious satellite aims at a final location at GEO after several self-orbital promotion for demonstration under different link conditions. To increase the link efficiency for longer distance and all-day communication, new techniques like larger telescopes, better acquiring, pointing and tracking (APT) system and adaptive optics are required. Large optical driving system indicates complexity of optical axis matching and attitude coupling control in the satellite. Space quantum experiment requires accurate orbit measurement to compensate for Doppler frequency errors in real time. The ultra-stable lasers, whose stability are extremely susceptible to external environmental disturbances, require a dedicated vibration isolation device and a systematic optimization of vibration performance. The microgravity in MEO/GEO will provide an ideal environment for space quantum experiment. However, it also has relatively higher requirements for micro-vibration acceleration, ambient magnetic field, temperature field and vacuity. Therefore, the new generation quantum satellite plan has posed a series of strict demands on satellite design, like mission orbit optimization, multi-payload integration, high-precision measurement and micro-vibration suppression. In order to explore the feasibility of the mission and provide effective solutions, this article firstly analyses the basic requirements for satellites based on mission needs, and then decomposes the system technical demand into system requirement, and finally identify key technologies for system design and engineering.

However, the time delay generated during the transmission will cause a significant threat to the stability and safe operation of the train. To overcome the effect of time delay on the train control system, based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and adaptive quantum particle swarm optimization (AQPSO) algorithms, a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) time delay prediction model is proposed in this paper. The EMD algorithm is used to decompose the time delay sequence into several subsequences, which emphasizes the different local characteristics of the time delay sequence. By improving the calculation method about the successful value of particle iteration, an AQPSO algorithm with adaptive contraction-expansion coefficient is designed to optimize the parameters of different LS-SVM models for predicting each time delay component, which improves the prediction accuracy of network delay. Further, based on actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm, an improved generalized predictive control method is proposed for the train network system. The actor-critic network is used to predict the future output of the system, and the recursive least squares identification algorithm with the variable forgetting factor is adopted to identify the future system model parameters. Combined with the time delay predicted accurately, the control quantity is sent in advance according to the properly arranged time series, which compensates efficiently the influence of the time delay on the control system. Simulation results show that compared with other control methods, the proposed method has better robustness and stability, which ensures the safe operation of high-speed trains under various working conditions. © 2020 Xiangyu Kong and Tong Zhang.",,10.1155/2020/6913579,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098482823&doi=10.1155%2f2020%2f6913579&partnerID=40&md5=1287578fba43494cfa5609d7d622207c,Article

919,Scopus,Hua & Liu (2020),2020,A Quantum-Inspired Genetic K-Means Algorithm for Gene Clustering,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"K-means is a widely used classical clustering algorithm in pattern recognition, image segmentation, bioinformatics and document clustering. But, it is easy to fall into local optimum and is sensitive to the initial choice of cluster centers. As a remedy, a popular trend is to integrate the swarm intelligence algorithm with K-means to obtain hybrid swarm intelligence K-means algorithms. Such as, K-means is combined with particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain particle swarm optimization K-means, and is also combined with genetic mechanism to obtain Genetic K-means algorithms. The classical K-means clustering algorithm requires the number of cluster centers in advance. In this paper, an automatic quantum genetic K-means algorithm for unknown K (AQGUK) is proposed to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the global convergence of AGUK. In AQGUK, a Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0–1 hyperspace using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as the genetic operations (selection, crossover and mutation) of Q-bits. The length of Q-bit individuals is variable during the evolution, which is Different from the typical genetic algorithms. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, AQGUK can obtain the optimal number of clusters and provide the optimal cluster centroids. Five gene datasets are used to validate AQGUK, AGUK and K-means. The experimental results show that AQGUK is effective and promising. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-030-64221-1_2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097648734&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-64221-1_2&partnerID=40&md5=ec94bbad422ed063166ce59f27d74b6d,Conference Paper

In this work, a fiber-based 16-channel multiplexer with different time delays was designed based on a construction scheme of 1 (1*4) coupler = 4 (1*4) couplers = 16*optical fibers - 4 (4*1) couplers - 1 (4*1) coupler. The lengths (di, i =1, 2,.16) of the optical fibers were manufactured to be 0 m, 8.0 m,. 120.0 m, respectively, with a length difference (Δd) of 8 m. The time delay between the optical fibers (Δt) can then be calculated to be 38.8ns. A pulsed 850 nm laser with a repetition rate of 1 MHz and a pulse duration of 10 ns was adopted to test the time-multiplexing capability of the 16-channel fiber coupler. A 1-GHz Si photodetector and a 1-GHz oscilloscope were used to measure the overall insertion loss and relative power through the 16 different channels. The photoelectric pulse count of the pulsed light passing through the fiber bundle will be measured. According to the loss of optical fiber and the photon detection efficiency of detector, we can roughly the photon detection efficiency of the system. If the fiber bundle with 16 entrances instead of only one, the scheme would be used as a detector array, and for imaging.

It is very much essential to bring down the energy use of every device deployed in the IoT network without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) for intelligent transportation system. To achieve this objective, a multiobjective optimisation problem to accomplish the aim of estimating the outage performance of clustering process and the network lifetime is devised.

Optical photons, unlike microwave photons, can be transmitted by fiber, making them suitable for long distance quantum communication. Moreover, the optical domain offers access to a large set of very well-developed quantum optical tools, such as highly efficient single-photon detectors and long-lived quantum memories. For a high fidelity microwave to optical transducer, efficient conversion at single photon level and low added noise is needed. Currently, the most promising approaches to build such systems are based on second-order nonlinear phenomena such as optomechanical and electro-optic interactions. Alternative approaches, although not yet as efficient, include magneto-optical coupling and schemes based on isolated quantum systems like atoms, ions, or quantum dots.

Namely, the parties seeking to achieve some cryptographic task, often start by establishing a common high-entropy secret that will eventually be used to secure their communication. In this paper, we put forward a security model for group key establishment (GAKE) with an adversary that may execute efficient quantum algorithms, yet only once the execution of the protocol has concluded. This captures a situation in which keys are to be established in the present, while security guarantees must still be provided in the future when quantum resources may be accessible to a potential adversary. Further, we propose a protocol design that can be proven secure in this model. Our proposal uses password authentication and builds upon efficient and reasonably well understood primitives: a message authentication code and a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism.

The development moved from large and costly spacecrafts to cost-efficient designs and shorter development times. While the satellites became smaller, the resolution of high compact sensors increased which led to a high data-volume to be transmitted and increasing demands for higher data rates on small satellites. This motivated for a highly compact version of DLR’s optical communication payload OSIRIS for small LEO satellites. DLR’s Institute of Communications and Navigation has developed the OSIRIS (Optical Space Infrared Downlink System) program starting with payloads on the satellites Flying Laptop of Univ. of Stuttgart and BiROS of DLR.

(2020),2020,Mammographic Image Conversion Between Source and Target Acquisition Systems Using cGAN,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Our work aims at developing a machine learning-based image conversion algorithm to adjust quantum noise, sharpness, scattering, and other characteristics of radiographic images acquired with a given imaging system as if they had been acquired with a different acquisition system. Purely physics-based methods which have previously been developed for image conversion rely on the measurement of the physical properties of the acquisition devices, which limit the range of their applicability. In this study, we focused on the conversion of mammographic images from a source acquisition system into a target system using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). This network penalizes any possible structural differences between network-generated and target images. The optimization process was enhanced by designing new reconstruction loss terms which emphasized the quality of high frequency image contents. We trained our cGAN model on a dataset of paired synthetic mammograms and slanted edge phantom images. We coupled one independent slanted edge phantom image with each anthropomorphic breast image and presented the pair as a combined input into the network. To improve network performance at high frequencies, we incorporated an edge-based loss function into the reconstruction loss. Qualitative results demonstrated the feasibility of our method to adjust the sharpness of mammograms acquired with a source system to appear as if the they were acquired with a different target system. Our method was validated by comparing the presampled modulation transfer function (MTF) of the network-generated edge image and the MTF of the source and target mammography acquisition systems at different spatial frequencies. This image conversion technique may help training of machine learning algorithms so that their applicability generalizes to a larger set of medical image acquisition devices.

This is so because India has not been able to impart segregation efficiently in its waste management logistic. Therefore, the only disposal method that is widely practiced to dispose solid waste is sanitary landfills. Landfills receiving such a huge quantum of waste need to be monitored and studied rigorously as they produce gaseous emissions and leachate. The dispersion or dissolution of these two phases of emissions is polluting the environment and affecting the public health and also the planet health. Therefore, to study the possible scenarios arising in the future from landfill, they are to be fragmented for each imparting factor.

In order to deliver the information securely, we propose a (t, n) threshold quantum visual secret sharing (QVSS) scheme based on Naor et al.’s visual secret sharing (VSS) scheme, which consists of two phases: sharing process and recovering process. In the firs process, the colour information of each pixel from the original secret image is encoded into an n × m-qubit superposition state, and then these qubits are distributed as shares to all participants, respectively. During the recovering process, at least t participants cooperate to collect these shares of each pixel together, then perform the corresponding measurements and recovering algorithm to recover the whole secret image. The proposed scheme has the advantage of single-pixel parallel processing that is not available in the existing analogous quantum schemes.

(2020),2020,Studies on practical cryptographic security analysis for block ciphers with random substitutions,International Journal of Computing,"In up-to-date information and communication systems (ICS) cryptography is used for ensuring data confidentiality. The symmetric block ciphers (BC) are implemented in different ICS including critical applications. Today theory of analysis and security verification of BC with fixed substitution nodes against linear and differential cryptanalysis (LDC) is developed. There are also BC with substitution nodes defined by round keys. Random substitution nodes improve security of ciphers and complicate its cryptanalysis. But through it all, quantitative assessment is an actual and not simple task as well as the derivation of formulas for practical security verification for BC with random substitution nodes against LDC. In this paper analytical upper bounds of parameters characterized practical security of BC with random substitution nodes against LDC were given. These assessments generalize known analogs on BC with random substitution nodes and give a possibility to verify security improving against LDC. By using the example of BC Kalyna-128, it was shown that the use of random substitution nodes allows improving upper bounds of linear and differential parameters average probabilities in 246 and 290 times respectively. The study is novel as it is one of the few in the cryptology field to calculate analytical upper bounds of BC practical security against LDC methods as well as to show and prove that using random substitutions allows improving upper bounds of linear and differential parameters. The security analysis using quantitative parameters gives possibility to evaluate various BCs or other cryptographic algorithms and their ability to provide necessary and sufficient security level in ICS.

In cancer research, variations of molecular docking have been employed for mapping protein-phytochemical interactions, seeking alternative approaches to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. In neurodegenerative pathologies, progressing research on phytotherapies may lead to effective substitutes for palliative treatments. In Parkinson’s disease, for instance, temporary relief results from usage of dopamine agonists, mimicking wild-field dopamine action, in the brain, and stimulating dopamine receptors. On the contrary, plant secondary metabolites are promising, offering long-term modulation of biomarkers for neuro-dysfunction. For nearly a decade, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been reporting on critical trends in cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disorders. According to WHO, in 2005, neuropathologies resulted in 92 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), a measure of disease burden, in terms of reducing life expectancy. The figures are projected to peak at 103 million in 2030, representing 12% increase. The predictions for Alzheimer and other dementias indicate 66% increase, between 2005 and 2030. Therefore, it urges finding effective measures to mitigate these trends. In 2017, regenerative medicine saw 5H-purin-6-amine from Sedum sarmentosum extracts, modulating signalling pathways, contributing to increase of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) activity. This is key in fertility studies, because 5H-purin-6-amine seems to induce SSC concentration within germ cells. However, the benefits of increasing phytochemical extracts-driven stem cell activity go beyond that, with the highmobility group box 1 (HMGB1) acting as a key upstream mediator in tissue regeneration. Computing is fast becoming a key instrument in drug discovery. Big data analytics and process automation are the domain knowledge revolutionising the field. On one hand, governing large volumes of heterogeneous information challenges drug development. On the other, it brings about rich sources of insights employed in unveiling new medicinal phenotypes and repurposing existing ones. One singular example derives from ontologies used to characterise molecular compounds, forming the basis of large annotated standardised information systems where medicinal compounds are assembled, in dictionaries (e.g. SNOMED) and semantic networks (e.g. Unified Medical Language System). Undoubtedly, the ability to correlate this data is fundamental, endowing conventional systems with cognitive power (e.g. biotechnology empowered by cognitive analytics), to analyse genotype-phenotype pairs, target compounds’ interactions, and track diseases’ biomarkers, to both elucidate and designate potential ligand-receptor binding prone to modulate dysfunction in diseases’ signalling cascades. Within this ambit, this chapter discusses how technology has revolutionised pharmacology. Special attention is given to phytocompound interactions and their role in drug development. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,10.1007/978-981-15-2361-8_24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089641237&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-2361-8_24&partnerID=40&md5=5e4b5ea897e48cca7d3552cb4219d176,Book Chapter

This study sought to apply these core technologies to future validated algorithms that make real estate transactions secure to come up with an encryption algorithm. In addition, the real estate transaction is being paid a large fee by the middlemen, the real estate agent. Furthermore and recently, P2P (peer-to-peer) real estate exchange is used a lot. However, these P2P real estate exchanges also have problems that have not been identified by each other between landlords and tenants. In particular, a research model was established to compare and verify the PBFT (practical Byzantine fault tolerance) algorithm of Hyperledger through the blockchain agreement process. Subsequently, a process for verifying the real estate contract was established. Through VM (virtual machine) research methodology for the verification of blockchain real estate contracts, ElGamal communication was provided to prove quantum cryptography. We also automated lightweight encryption test verification tools and blockchain smart contract VM (virtual machine) models using artificial intelligence. Verification was performed through a reservation server and a monitoring server using a test verification tool for network-based lightweight security IoT (Internet of things) GW (gateway). It presents important ECP (elastic curve program) and elastic curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) models among the main functions of the blockchain smart contract, and it is equipped with quantum-based encryption algorithm. In addition, the necessary UML (unified modeling language) source code and performance data were calculated according to the actual experimental environment, and the average value for blockchain for administrative or government authorized assets—4000 TPS (transaction per second) were tested. In the future, we want to use this technology for real estate transactions. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite the great variety of cryptographic applications blind signatures also found their way in real-world scenarios. Due to the expected progress in cryptanalysis using quantum computers, it remains an important research question to find practical and secure alternatives to current systems based on the hardness of classical security assumptions such as factoring and computing discrete logarithms. In this work we present BLAZE: a new practical blind signature scheme from lattice assumptions. With respect to all relevant efficiency metrics BLAZE is more efficient than all previous blind signature schemes based on assumptions conjectured to withstand quantum computer attacks. For instance, at approximately 128 bits of security signatures are as small as 6.6 KB, which represents an improvement factor of 2.7 compared to all previous candidates, and an expansion factor of 2.5 compared to the NIST PQC submission. Our software implementation demonstrates the efficiency of BLAZE to be deployed in practical applications. In particular, generating a blind signature takes just 18 ms. The running time of both key generation and verification is in the same order as state-of-the-art ordinary signature schemes. © 2020, International Financial Cryptography Association.",,10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089221002&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-51280-4_26&partnerID=40&md5=7d2f2ca9a08fb24b8ee5ec2266c040da,Conference Paper

Our work explores the feasibility of using the D-Wave as a sampler for a machine learning task. We describe a hybrid method that combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum annealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave for image generation. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the 2000-qubit D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate typical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions, and samples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a lossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how generating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28 images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed to recreating the training samples. We evaluated the quality of this method by using a downstream classification method. We formulated a MNIST classification problem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from the quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with a MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as a MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. We also explored using a secondary dataset, the MNIST Fashion dataset and demonstrate the first quantum-generated fashion. Our hybrid autoencoder approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current RBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even more promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system. Our method for compression and image mappings is not constrained to RBMs, the autoencoder part of this method could be coupled with other quantum-based algorithms. © 2020 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2558832,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087762955&doi=10.1117%2f12.2558832&partnerID=40&md5=7d7f031776ee5214df6fb3a48b0c8abc,Conference Paper

However, a Si optical phase shifter based on the free-carrier effect is facing the fundamental difficulty to achieve its modulation bandwidth beyond 100 GHz because of the tradeoff relationship between the modulation efficiency and optical loss. The huge power consumption and slow switching speed of a thermo-optic phase shifter are also issues for programmable photonic integrated circuits for computing. To overcome this obstacle, we have investigated the hybrid integration of III-V semiconductors on Si photonics platform. In particular, we have proposed a III-V/Si hybrid metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor for phase modulation, where an n-type III-V membrane is bonded on a p-type Si waveguide with a gate oxide. A III-V/Si hybrid MOS capacitor enables electrons accumulation at the III-V MOS interface, contributing to efficient and low-loss optical phase modulation owing to the superior electron-induced refractive index change in III-V to in Si.

Moreover, due to recent, rapid growth of quantum technologies, most common security mechanisms considered secure today may be soon imperilled. Thus, the modern security mechanisms during their construction also require the power of quantum technologies to resist various potential attacks from quantum computers. Because of its characteristics, quantum walks (QW) is considered as a universal quantum computation paradigm that can be accepted as an excellent key generator. In this regard, in this paper a new lightweight image encryption scheme based on QW for secure data transfer in the internet of things platforms and wireless networking with edge computing is proposed. The introduced approach utilises the power of nonlinear dynamic behaviour of QW to construct permutation boxes and generates pseudo-random numbers for encrypting the plain image after dividing it into blocks. The results of the conducted simulation and numerical analyses confirm that the presented encryption algorithm is effective. The encrypted images have randomness properties, no useful data about the ciphered image can be obtained via analysing the correlation of adjacent pixels. Moreover, the entropy value is close to 8, the number of the pixel change rate is greater than 99.61%, and there is high sensitivity of the key parameters with large key space to resist various attacks. © 2013 IEEE.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992820,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085643723&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.2992820&partnerID=40&md5=4d35e81b7b639f2e3d3ae219606ad6f6,Article

Quantum dots seem to be ideal to address the challenges in the further development of various semiconductor applications, such as high-resolution spectroscopy or broad- band optical communication networks, for which a range of spectral and temporal characteristics is required, for instance a narrow spectral linewidth, low intensity noise or wide wavelength tunability. In this view, exter- nal cavity quantum dot gain chips can be envisoned to replace the current quantum well technology. Using a semi-analytical rate equation model, we successfully analyze both dynamical and noise properties of an external cavity laser made with quantum dot gain medium, operating under strong optical feedback.

Their integration in photonic structures such as photonic crystals, microdisks, microring resonators, and nanopillars is essential for their deployment in quantum technologies. While there are currently only two material platforms (diamond and silicon carbide) with proven single-photon emission from the visible to infrared, a quantum spin-photon interface, and ancilla qubits, it is expected that other material platforms could emerge with similar characteristics in the near future. These two materials also naturally lead to monolithic integrated photonics as both are good photonic materials. While so far the verification of single-photon sources was based on discovery, assignment and then assessment and control of their quantum properties for applications, a better approach could be to identify applications and then search for the material that could address the requirements of the application in terms of quantum properties of the defects. This approach is quite difficult as it is based mostly on the reliability of modeling and predicting of color center properties in various materials, and their experimental verification is challenging. In this paper, we review some recent advances in an emerging material, low-dimensional (2D, 1D, 0D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which could lead to establishing such a platform.

CCN/NDN allows network communication based on content names and also allows users to obtain information from any of the nearest intermediary caches on the network. Due to that, the ability of cached content to protect itself is essential since contents can be cached on any node everywhere, and publishers may not have total control over their own published data. The attribute based encryption (ABE) scheme is a preferable approach, identified to enable cached contents to be self-secured since it has a special property of encryption with policies. However, most of the proposed ABE schemes for CCN/NDN suffer from some loopholes. They are not flexible in the expression of access policy, they are inefficient, they are based on bilinear maps with pairings, and they are vulnerable to quantum cryptography algorithms. Hence, we propose the ciphertext policy attribute based encryption access control (CP-ABE AC) scheme from a lightweight ideal lattice based on ring learning with error (R-LWE) problem, and demonstrated its use in practical applications. The proposed scheme is proved to be secure and efficient under the decision ring LWE problem in the selective set model. To achieve an efficient scheme, we used an efficient trapdoor technique and the access tree representation of access structure describing the access policies was modified into a new structure, based on a reduced ordered binary decision diagram (reduce-OBDD). This access structure can support Boolean operations such as AND, NOT, OR, and threshold gates. The final result showed that the proposed scheme was secure and efficient for applications, thereby supporting CCN/NDN as a promising paradigm. © 2020 by the authors.",,10.3390/SYM12010166,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083977487&doi=10.3390%2fSYM12010166&partnerID=40&md5=7904444d0dc1596fc7f5062c3dfb9b3e,Article

However, the recent discovery on electrons in spiral motion producing twisted radiation with AM, including Spin Angular Momentum (SAM) and Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), proves that the continuous value of AM is available in the statistical EM wave beam. This is also revealed by the so-called fractional OAM, which is reported in optical OAM beams.

Structural analysis of CsPbBr3 QDs results in an optimized lattice parameter of 5.885 Å. Electronic properties of CsPbBr3 QDs have been investigated by means of electronic band structure, the partial density of states (PDOS) and total density of states (TDOS) calculations. A direct band gap of 2.38 eV has been observed at the Gamma (γ) point in its Brillouin Zone. Analysis of PDOS shows upper valence band and conduction band of the CsPbBr3 are due to the Br (4p) orbital and Pb (6p) orbitals respectively. Moreover, the optical absorption coefficient has been also calculated using Kubo-Greenwood formula in a frame work of DFT. The optical absorption spectrum lies in both the visible and ultraviolet region. To confirm the feasibility of the above theoretical results, experiments have been also done. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern show consistent result in the lattice parameter with a calculated value of 5.841 Å.

To route the secure QKD traffic to the end-users, 1x2, 1x4, 1x8 and 1x12 switching configurations have been analyzed for the transmission distance ranging from 0 to 60 km. We have achieved the secure key rates of 30 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s for the 1x12 and 1x2 switching configurations, respectively. We have also compared the performance of routed QKD traffic with a simple point-to-point QKD system and the classical DV-QKD protocol. The QKD networks need an effective low-loss fibre channel and a distribution system to enhance the transmission distance of the secure keys and applications. This paper provides multi-user used case as an important paradigm with the corresponding scheme and simulation performances. © 2020 IEEE.",,10.1109/ICOIN48656.2020.9016434,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082130267&doi=10.1109%2fICOIN48656.2020.9016434&partnerID=40&md5=ff72c20d882ca812b5dbf7da697ba552,Conference Paper
955,Scopus,Rios et al. (2020),2020,Multiscale Structural Characterization of Biobased Diallyl-Eugenol Polymer Networks,ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,"Biosourced eugenol-based polymer networks have a potential functionality for antibacterial coating applications. The presence of carvacrol, a phenol compound, improves these properties. However, the relationship between the network structure and the macroscopic thermomechanical behavior is not known for these biopolymers. Thus, this work details a robust study of this relationship through a multiscale experimental approach combining Dielectric Spectroscopy, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis, tensile testing, and Time Domain Double-Quantum proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (DQ 1H NMR). It was shown that carvacrol has an influence on the molecular mobility of the materials. Namely, it induces the appearance of a shouldering on the γrelaxation and a diminishing of the main molecular α relaxation, Tα. More surprisingly, up to 20% wt, carvacrol increases the elastic E′ and Young's E moduli. This observation can be interpreted as an increase of the crosslink density of the networks. Time Domain DQ 1H NMR shows that the residual dipolar coupling constant also increases. Thus, carvacrol seems to act as both a thermal plasticizer and mechanical reinforcement, which may seem to be antagonistic trends. For carvacrol contents over 20% wt, these properties diminish because of a saturation of this molecule in the networks and the onset of a phase separation. By combining the aforementioned techniques, it was proven that carvacrol linearly increased the measured crosslink density and thermomechanical properties by physically bonding to the networks through Ï-πinteractions. These interactions would act as physical crosslinks. This work demonstrates that by correlating the results of various multiscale experimental techniques, a better comprehension of the structure-property relationship can be established for biobased functional polymer networks. © Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.macromol.9b02280,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081687857&doi=10.1021%2facs.macromol.9b02280&partnerID=40&md5=56b31e67f58afa3ca5a4c09a1f1fc433,Article

(2020),2020,Quantum Key Distribution over Double-Layer Quantum Satellite Networks,IEEE Access,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) has attracted much attention on secure communications across global networks. QKD over satellite networks can overcome the limitations of terrestrial optical networks, such as large attenuation over long distance fiber channel and difficulty of intercontinental domain communications. Different QKD networks (around the world) can intercommunicate through quantum satellites, leading to a global quantum network in near future. This raises a new resource allocation and management problem of QKD involving multiple satellite layers and distributed ground stations. Using existing schemes, a single satellite cannot perform QKD for ground stations for the whole day. Moreover, the research problem is more challenging due to limitations of satellite coverage: limited cover time of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite, high channel losses of geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite, etc. To overcome these limitations, our study proposes a double-layer quantum satellite network (QSN) implemented quantum key pool (QKP) to relay keys for ground stations. We propose a new architecture of trusted-repeater-based double-layer quantum satellite networks, comprising GEO and LEO satellites. We also address the routing and key allocation (RKa) problem for key-relay services over QSNs. We propose a novel joint GEO-LEO routing and key allocation (JGL-RKa) algorithm to solve the RKa problem.

In this structure, the transparency peak of the bi-layer metallic EIT metamaterial can realize on-to-off switch through shifting the Fermi energy of graphene covering onto the dark mode resonators. Theoretical analysis and surface current distributions reveal that the active modulation can be attributed to the increasing damping rate of the dark mode caused by the actively controllable conductivity of the graphene.

This move from classical computing to quantum computing is shown to theoretically enhance the scalability and speed of distributed consensus as well as improve security and be a potential solution for the problem of blockchain interoperability. Using this method may circumvent the common problem known as the Blockchain Trilemma, enhancing scalability and speed without sacrificing de-centralization or byzantine fault tolerance [1]. Consensus speed and scalability is shown by removing the need for multicast responses and exploiting quantum properties to ensure that only a single multicast is required. We also leverage work done on the E91 quantum key distribution protocol [2] to securely transmit values and prevent a man-in-the-middle attack or system disturbance, enhancing confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information. Distributed ledger interoperability is explored by proposing a system to achieve a verifiable bridge for private transactions between a small private network and its corresponding consortium network. A proof-of-concept using IBM's Qskit is shown from which initial results appear to show a strong sensitivity to non-consensus which could be useful in many applications.

In order to ensure the quantitative comparability of the observed data of aerosol lidar, in September 2017, the CMA Meteorological Observation Centre carried out the first megacity experiment in the South suburb Observatory of Beijing. In the calibration test of aerosol lidar, the hardware system calibration of six lidars and the calibration of 2km-5km are completed by using the method of statistical analysis. This is the second aerosol calibration test of the Megacity Experiment in 2018. For the first time, the standard aerosol lidar developed by the University of Naples in Europe is introduced as the standard source, and 10 lidars from different manufacturers participating in the joint test are calibrated and compared at the same site at the same time. The results show that: REAL LIDAR as a reference source is equivalent to the calibration results using statistical methods. In the future, REAL LIDAR can be used as a standard to calibrate other lidar by means of quantum transfer. In this paper, the system deviation and standard deviation of backscatter coefficient of 1-8 km are obtained, and the results meet the calibration requirements of European EARLINET.

Different arrangements of chemical elements in differently shaped Periodic Tables serve for different purposes. ""Can this Periodic Table be derived from quantum chemistry or physics?"" can only be answered positively, if the internal structure of the Periodic Table is explicitly connected to facts and data from chemistry. Quantum chemical rationalization of such a Periodic Tables is achieved by explaining the details of energies and radii of atomic core and valence orbitals in the leading electron configurations of chemically bonded atoms. The coarse horizontal pseudo-periodicity in seven rows of 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32 members is triggered by the low energy of and large gap above the 1s and nsp valence shells (2 ≤ n ≤ 6 !). The pseudo-periodicity, in particular the wavy variation of the elemental properties in the four longer rows, is due to the different behaviors of the s and p vs. d and f pairs of atomic valence shells along the ordered array of elements. The so-called secondary or vertical periodicity is related to pseudo-periodic changes of the atomic core shells. The Periodic Law of the naturally given System of Elements describes the trends of the many chemical properties displayed inside the Chemical Periodic Tables. While the general physical laws of quantum mechanics form a simple network, their application to the unlimited field of chemical materials under ambient 'human' conditions results in a complex and somewhat accidental structure inside the Table that fits to some more or less symmetric outer shape.

However, the lack of an efficient UV photodetection methodology hinders the development of UV-based communication. The key technological impediment is related to the low UV-photon absorption in existing silicon photodetectors, which offer low-cost and mature platforms. To address this technology gap, we report a hybrid Si-based photodetection scheme by incorporating CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a fast photoluminescence (PL) decay time as a UV-to-visible colour-converting layer for high-speed solar-blind UV communication. The facile formation of drop-cast CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs leads to a high PLQY of up to ~73% and strong absorption in the UV region. With the addition of the NC layer, a nearly threefold improvement in the responsivity and an increase of ~25% in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar-blind region compared to a commercial silicon-based photodetector were observed. Moreover, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrated a decay time of 4.5 ns under a 372-nm UV excitation source, thus elucidating the potential of this layer as a fast colour-converting layer. A high data rate of up to 34 Mbps in solar-blind communication was achieved using the hybrid CsPbBr3–silicon photodetection scheme in conjunction with a 278-nm UVC light-emitting diode (LED).

(2019),2019,Quantum key distribution with setting-choice-independently correlated light sources,npj Quantum Information,"Despite the enormous theoretical and experimental progress made so far in quantum key distribution (QKD), the security of most existing practical QKD systems is not rigorously established yet. A critical obstacle is that almost all existing security proofs make ideal assumptions on the QKD devices. Problematically, such assumptions are hard to satisfy in the experiments, and therefore it is not obvious how to apply such security proofs to practical QKD systems. Fortunately, any imperfections and security-loopholes in the measurement devices can be perfectly closed by measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), and thus we only need to consider how to secure the source devices. Among imperfections in the source devices, correlations between the sending pulses and modulation fluctuations are one of the principal problems, which unfortunately most of the existing security proofs do not consider. In this paper, we take into account these imperfections and enhance the implementation security of QKD. Specifically, we consider a setting-choice-independent correlation (SCIC) framework in which the sending pulses can present arbitrary correlations but they are independent of the previous setting choices such as the bit, the basis and the intensity settings. Within the framework of SCIC, we consider the dominant fluctuations of the sending states, such as the relative phases and the intensities, and provide a self-contained information-theoretic security proof for the loss-tolerant QKD protocol in the finite-key regime. We demonstrate the feasibility of secure quantum communication, and thus our work constitutes a crucial step towards guaranteeing the security of practical QKD systems. © 2019, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41534-018-0122-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069671331&doi=10.1038%2fs41534-018-0122-y&partnerID=40&md5=7a1a2ac48f8ddafa86767c28985309ea,Article

Fortunately, machine learning techniques for pattern recognition and image classification, using so-called deep neural networks, have shown surprising successes for computer-aided understanding of complex systems. We propose a new paradigm for fully automated experimental initialization through a closed-loop system relying on machine learning and optimization techniques. We use deep convolutional neural networks to characterize states and charge configurations of semiconductor quantum dot arrays when only measurements of a current−voltage characteristic of transport are available. For simplicity, we model a semiconductor nanowire connected to leads and capacitively coupled to depletion gates using the Thomas−Fermi approximation and Coulomb blockade physics. We then generate labeled training data for the neural networks, and find at least 90 % accuracy for charge and state identification for single and double dots. Using these characterization networks, we can then optimize the parameter space to achieve a desired configuration of the array, a technique we call “auto-tuning”. Finally, we show how such techniques can be implemented in an experimental setting by applying our approach to an experimental dataset, and outline further problems in this domain, from using charge sensing data to extensions to full one- and two-dimensional arrays, that can be tackled with machine learning. © 2019, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41534-018-0118-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063770388&doi=10.1038%2fs41534-018-0118-7&partnerID=40&md5=524ecaaa72baa0691c4457aa408dcd64,Article

Of particular interest are sources that are based on a single quantum system as these offer intrinsic security due to the sub-Poissonian nature of the photon emission process. This is important for applications in quantum communication where multi-pair emission generally compromises performance. A large variety of sources has been developed, but the generated photons remained far from being utilized in established standard fiber networks, mainly due to lack of compatibility with telecommunication wavelengths. In this regard, single semiconductor quantum dots are highly promising photon pair sources as they can be engineered for direct emission at telecom wavelengths. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. We report a week-long transmission of polarization-entangled photons from a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot over a metropolitan network fiber.

991,Scopus,Qi et al. (2019),2019,Implementation and security analysis of practical quantum secure direct communication,Light: Science and Applications,"Rapid development of supercomputers and the prospect of quantum computers are posing increasingly serious threats to the security of communication. Using the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum communication offers provable security of communication and is a promising solution to counter such threats. Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is one important branch of quantum communication. In contrast to other branches of quantum communication, it transmits secret information directly. Recently, remarkable progress has been made in proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations of QSDC. However, it remains a technical feat to bring QSDC into a practical application. Here, we report the implementation of a practical quantum secure communication system. The security is analyzed in the Wyner wiretap channel theory. The system uses a coding scheme of concatenation of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and works in a regime with a realistic environment of high noise and high loss. The present system operates with a repetition rate of 1 MHz at a distance of 1.5 kilometers. The secure communication rate is 50 bps, sufficient to effectively send text messages and reasonably sized files of images and sounds. © 2019, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41377-019-0132-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061101859&doi=10.1038%2fs41377-019-0132-3&partnerID=40&md5=c4065b4b361ac40c2a9ca6167cb03094,Article

In many instances, the chemical structure of the bridge determines how the two parts it is connecting communicate, and does so in ways that are transferable between these different manifestations (for example, high conductance often correlates with strong antiferromagnetic spin coupling, and low conductance due to destructive quantum interference correlates with ferromagnetic coupling). Defining electronic communication as a transferable property of the bridge can help transfer knowledge between these different areas of research. Examples and limits of such transferability are discussed here, along with some possible directions for future research, such as employing spin-coupled and mixed-valence systems as structurally well-controlled proxies for understanding molecular conductance and for validating first-principles theoretical methodologies, building conceptual understanding for the growing experimental work on intramolecular singlet fission, and developing measures for the transferability of electronic communication as a bridge property.

Despite the tremendous efforts of scientists, the progress of integration of a phototransistor, where the built-in electric field separates the photogenerated excitons, and a light-emitting diode, where the radiative recombination can be enhanced by band offset, into a single device remains a challenge. Combining the superior properties of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and graphene, here we report a light-emissive, ultrasensitive, ultrafast, and broadband vertical phototransistor that can simultaneously act as an efficient photodetector and light emitter within a single device.

However, hardware-based TPM has several intrinsic problems such as extremely low performance, off-chip security vulnerability, and a lack of incident response agility. In the upcoming Quantum computing era, it is critical to provide Quantum-Resistant (QR) cryptography functions without harming performance. Unfortunately, hardware-based TPM's rigid hardware and software architecture model makes it extremely difficult for hardware-based TPM to transition to accommodate future QR cryptographic systems. On the other hand, software-based TPMs (e.g., firmware-based TPM) provide a CPU-based, on-chip security solution. They utilize low-level on-chip primitives offered by chipsets such as ARM TrustZone or Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to build a system with a high-level of trust computing environment. A software-based TPM solution provides higher performance, on-chip security, and incident response agility. However, it is lacking in hardware-backed protection and several vital features such as secure key storage, robustness against side-channel attacks, true random number generation, among others. In addition, its implementation is highly dependent on low-level primitives provided by each hardware vendor, which makes it difficult for it to be provided as a generalized solution. In this paper, we propose hybrid-TPM (hTPM), which fully utilizes the advantages of a hardware-based TPM and diminishes a hardware-based TPM's weaknesses through software-based TPM solutions inside a secure container, e.g., Virtualization-Based Security (VBS). We implemented hTPM as a fully dual mode TPM, i.e., giving end-users full control in choosing between a hardware TPM mode and a software TPM mode based on their needs. We performed and will provide a full risk analysis of the proposed hTPM to show how to best overcome security challenges in realizing hTPM.

Their optical, physical and luminescence properties were studied, for their potential applications in photonic device working in visible region. The Sm3+ ions and nearby ligands bonding nature were determined from bonding parameters (δ) that in turn were calculated from LGF absorption spectra. Oscillator strength of different absorption bands and Judd–Ofelt (JO) parameters (Ωλ (λ = 2, 4, 6)) were measured. JO-parameters and refractive index have been used to valuate various radiative properties of Sm3+ ions emission transitions in prepared glasses to explore their potential application as visible lasers. Furthermore, the emission was studied by exciting the LGF glass samples with different wavelengths (λex = 275, 402 nm). The orange to red ratios at different wavelengths (λex = 275 nm and X-ray) were evaluated to measure the Sm3+-ions local disorder in the glass network. The decreasing trend in experimental decay time (τexp) with Sm3+-ion concentration increasing was observed due to energy transfer. Best fit for the prepared glass, when studied in the light of Inokuti–Hirayama model was obtained for S = 6 indicating dipole–dipole type of energy transfer. The intense visible (orange) emission, high stimulated emission cross-section (σe), branching ratios (βR), radiative transition probability (AR), and reasonable quantum efficiency were determined for transition from 4G5/2 to 6H7/2 in glass.

With increasing interest, security concerns for those circuits also will rise in the near future. At first glance, reversible circuits seem to be more secure to integrated circuit (IC)/intellectual property (IP) piracy than conventional circuits, since the target function is usually embedded in the reversible backbone circuit. This embedding adds ancillary inputs and garbage outputs that may appear to hide the target function. However, recent work showed that target function embedding and reversible synthesis methods leave telltale signs in the reversible circuits, which allow for an easy extraction of the synthesis approach and the embedded circuit. In this article, we perform an analysis of the IC/IP piracy attacks on reversible circuits. We focus on the reversible circuits generated by the quantum multivalued decision diagram (QMDD)- and binary decision diagram (BDD)-based synthesis approaches as case studies. We show that most of the target function can be identified using the telltale signs of the synthesis approach. We then propose a cost-effective input-output scrambling scheme that wipes out these telltale signs and, thus, thwarts the considered attacks by adding reversible gates.

The non-linear dynamics are analyzed with bifurcation diagrams. While for quasi-continuous wave operation, chaos is found to be more complex, pure continuous wave pumping always leads to the generation of a regular spiking induced low-frequency fluctuations dynamics. In the latter, results show that by combining external optical feedback with periodic forcing and further induced current modulation allows a better control of the chaotic dropouts.

By incorporating molecularly engineered DNA sequences into a polymeric network, a new type of responsive hydrogel (D-gel), whose overall morphology is dynamically controlled by DNA hybridization-induced double crosslinking is able to be created. As a step toward manufacturing, the D-gel in combination with a bottom-up 3D printing technology is employed to rapidly create modular macroscopic structures that feature programmable reconfiguration and directional movement, which can even mimic the complex gestures of human hands. Mechanical operations such as catch and release are demonstrated by a proof-of-concept hydrogel palm, which possessed great promise for future engineering applications. Compared with previously developed DNA hydrogels, the D-gel features an ease of synthesis, faster response, and a high degree of programmable control. Moreover, it is possible to scale up the production of D-gel containing responsive devices through direct 3D printing. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

1010,Scopus,Pearlman et al. (2019),2019,The ILRS: approaching 20 years and planning for the future,Journal of Geodesy,"The International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) was established by the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) in 1998 to support programs in geodesy, geophysics, fundamental constants and lunar research, and to provide the International Earth Rotation Service with data products that are essential to the maintenance and improvement in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), the basis for metric measurements of changes in the Earth and Earth–Moon system. Other scientific products derived from laser ranging include precise geocentric positions and motions of ground stations, satellite orbits, components of Earth’s gravity field and their temporal variations, Earth Orientation Parameters, precise lunar ephemerides and information about the internal structure of the Moon. Laser ranging systems are already measuring the one-way distance to remote optical receivers in space and are performing very accurate time transfer between remote sites in the Earth and in Space. The ILRS works closely with the IAG’s Global Geodetic Observing System. The ILRS develops (1) the standards and specifications necessary for product consistency, and (2) the priorities and tracking strategies required to maximize network efficiency. The service collects, merges, analyzes, archives and distributes satellite and lunar laser ranging data to satisfy a variety of scientific, engineering, and operational needs and encourages the application of new technologies to enhance the quality, quantity, and cost effectiveness of its data products. The ILRS works with (1) new satellite missions in the design and building of retroreflector targets to maximize data quality and quantity, and (2) science programs to optimize scientific data yield. Since its inception, the ILRS has grown to include forty laser ranging stations distributed around the world. The ILRS stations track more than ninety satellites from low Earth orbit (LEO) to the geosynchronous orbit altitude as well as retroreflector arrays on the surface of the Moon. Applications have been expanded to include time transfer, asynchronous ranging for targets at extended ranges, free space quantum telecommunications, and the tracking of space debris. Laser ranging technology is moving to lower energy, higher repetition rates (kHz), single-photon-sensitive detectors, shorter pulse widths, shorter normal point intervals for faster data acquisition, and increased pass interleaving, automated to autonomous operation with remote access, and embedded software for real-time updates and decision making. An example of pass interleaving is presented for the Yarragadee station (see Fig. 4); tracking of LEO satellites is often accommodated during break in LEO and GNSS passes. New satellites arrays provide more compact targets and work continues on the development of lighter less expensive arrays for satellites and the moon. The service now provides operational ITRF products including daily/weekly station positions and daily resolution Earth orientation products; the flow of weekly combination of satellite orbit files for LAGEOS/Etalon-1 and -2 has recently been established. New products are under testing through a pilot project on systematic error monitoring currently underway. The article will give an overview of activities underway within the service, paths forward presently envisioned, and current issues and challenges. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.",,10.1007/s00190-019-01241-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063214232&doi=10.1007%2fs00190-019-01241-1&partnerID=40&md5=a00dd36eb792a93170c985381870f520,Article
1011,Scopus,Zhuang & Zhang (2019),2019,Physical-Layer Supervised Learning Assisted by an Entangled Sensor Network,Physical Review X,"Many existing quantum supervised learning (SL) schemes consider data given a priori in a classical description. With only noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices available in the near future, their quantum speedup awaits the development of quantum random access memories (qRAMs) and fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, there also exist a multitude of SL tasks whose data are acquired by sensors, e.g., pattern classification based on data produced by imaging sensors. Solving such SL tasks naturally requires an integrated approach harnessing tools from both quantum sensing and quantum computing. We introduce supervised learning assisted by an entangled sensor network (SLAEN) as a means to carry out SL tasks at the physical layer. The entanglement shared by the sensors in SLAEN boosts the performance of extracting global features of the object under investigation. We leverage SLAEN to construct an entanglement-assisted support-vector machine for data classification and entanglement-assisted principal component analyzer for data compression. In both schemes, variational circuits are employed to seek the optimum entangled probe states and measurement settings to maximize the entanglement-enabled enhancement. We observe that SLAEN enjoys an appreciable entanglement-enabled performance gain, even in the presence of loss, over conventional strategies in which classical data are acquired by separable sensors and subsequently processed by classical SL algorithms. SLAEN is realizable with available technology, opening a viable route toward building NISQ devices that offer unmatched performance beyond what the optimum classical device is able to afford. © 2019 authors.

Such techniques are realized, for example, by monitoring for photon loss at the receiving end of the quantum channel while not disturbing the transmitted quantum state. We describe and experimentally benchmark a scheme that incorporates error detection in a direct quantum channel connecting two transmon qubits using traveling microwave photons. This is achieved by encoding the quantum information as a time-bin superposition of a single photon, which simultaneously realizes high communication rates and high fidelities.

Driven by a simple DC current, the devices generate flat broadband frequency combs, containing tens of equidistant optical tones with line spacings of tens of GHz. Here we show that QD-MLLDs can not only be used as multi-wavelength light sources at a WDM transmitter, but also as multi-wavelength local oscillators (LO) for parallel coherent reception. In our experiments, we demonstrate transmission of an aggregate net data rate of 3.9 Tbit/s (23 × 45 GBd PDM-QPSK, 7% FEC overhead) over 75 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF).

Among the various comb generator concepts, quantum-dash (QD) mode-locked laser diodes (MLLD) stand out as a particularly promising option, combining small footprint with simple operation by a DC current and offering flat broadband comb spectra. However, the data transmission performance achieved with QD-MLLD was so far limited by strong phase noise of the individual comb tones, restricting experiments to rather simple modulation formats such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) or requiring hardware-based compensation schemes. Here we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by digital symbol-wise blind phase search (BPS) techniques, avoiding any hardware-based phase-noise compensation. We demonstrate 16QAM dual-polarization WDM transmission on 38 channels at an aggregate net data rate of 10.68 Tbit/s over 75 km of standard single-mode fiber.

Yet, progress toward that goal remains elusive due to lack of electro-optic translators that can efficiently convert electrical activity to high photon count optical signals. Here, we introduce an ultrasensitive and extremely bright nanoscale electric-field probe overcoming the low photon count limitations of existing optical field reporters. Our electro-plasmonic nanoantennas with drastically enhanced cross sections (~104 nm2 compared to typical values of ~10−2 nm2 for voltage-sensitive fluorescence dyes and ~1 nm2 for quantum dots) offer reliable detection of local electric-field dynamics with remarkably high sensitivities and signal-to-shot noise ratios (~60 to 220) from diffraction-limited spots. In our electro-optics experiments, we demonstrate high-temporal resolution electric-field measurements at kilohertz frequencies and achieved label-free optical recording of network-level electrogenic activity of cardiomyocyte cells with low-intensity light (11 mW/mm2).

(2019),2019,"Detecting and Characterizing the Kinetic Activation of Thermal Networks in Proteins: Thermal Transfer from a Distal, Solvent-Exposed Loop to the Active Site in Soybean Lipoxygenase",Journal of Physical Chemistry B,"The rate-limiting chemical reaction catalyzed by soybean lipoxygenase (SLO) involves quantum mechanical tunneling of a hydrogen atom from substrate to its active site ferric-hydroxide cofactor. SLO has emerged as a prototypical system for linking the thermal activation of a protein scaffold to the efficiency of active site chemistry. Significantly, hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments on wild type and mutant forms of SLO have uncovered trends in the enthalpic barriers for HDX within a solvent-exposed loop (positions 317-334) that correlate well with trends in the corresponding enthalpic barriers for kcat. A model for this behavior posits that collisions between water and loop 317-334 initiate thermal activation at the protein surface that is then propagated 15-34 Å inward toward the reactive carbon of substrate in proximity to the iron catalyst. In this study, we have prepared protein samples containing cysteine residues either at the tip of the loop 317-334 (Q322C) or on a control loop, 586-603 (S596C). Chemical modification of cysteines with the fluorophore 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Badan, BD) provides site-specific probes for the measurement of fluorescence relaxation lifetimes and Stokes shift decays as a function of temperature. Computational studies indicate that surface water structure is likely to be largely preserved in each sample. While both loops exhibit temperature-independent fluorescence relaxation lifetimes as do the Stokes shifts for S596C-BD, the activation enthalpy for the nanosecond solvent reorganization at Q322C-BD (Ea(ksolv) = 2.8(0.9) kcal/mol)) approximates the enthalpy of activation for catalytic C-H activation (Ea(kcat) = 2.3(0.4) kcal/mol). This study establishes and validates the methodology for measuring rates of rapid local motions at the protein/solvent interface of SLO. These new findings, when combined with previously published correlations between protein motions and the rate-limiting hydride transfer in a thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase, provide experimental evidence for thermally induced ""protein quakes"" as the origin of enthalpic barriers in catalysis.

The in situ growth of the CsPbX3 particles inside amorphous glass can significantly improve their stability. Unfortunately, it is formidably difficult to precipitate whole-family CsPbX3 from a glass matrix and their photoluminescence quantum yields require further improvement. Herein, fluoride additives were introduced into oxyhalide borosilicate glasses to break the tight glass network, which promoted the nucleation/growth of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Cl/Br, Br, Br/I and I) inside the glass. Importantly, the quantum efficiencies of glass-stabilized CsPbBr3, CsPb(Br/I)3 and CsPbI3 reached 80%, 60% and 50%, respectively, which are the highest efficiencies reported so far. Benefiting from the effective protection of robust glass, CsPbX3 quantum dots exhibited superior water resistance with more than 90% luminescence remaining after immersing them in water for 30 days, and halogen anion exchange among different CsPbX3 materials was completely inhibited.

Eight LCTs 135, 1064 nm wavelength are/have been in operation in the past six years. Two LCTs are on board of geostationary satellites (GEOs) and six are/were on board of low-orbit satellites (LEOs) covering wide range of missions from earth observation (e.g. Copernicus program) and surveillance to technology demonstrator payloads (e.g. TDP1 Experimentation Program) [1] [2]. Space to ground links (SGLs) have been demonstrated using different art of optical ground stations (OGS). Up- and down-optical links with and without communication between the Technology Demonstrator Payload 1 (TDP1) and the DLR Transportable Adaptive Optics Ground Station (T-AOGS) [12] have been used for experimental purpose, contributing to the data generation for atmospheric modelling and supporting the experts in building a better understanding of atmospheric impact onto the optical channel [3]. In order to implement and operate the LCTs, new operational concepts have been developed. Generation of operational products like link requests or commanding files has been supported and tuned [5] [2]. Further technology applications like airborne terminals are currently under validation. In 2019, several companies have started the verification of their terminals using the E2E test bed TDP1 and the T-AOGS described in [4]. Testing campaigns are ongoing in 2019. The TDP1 test bed has also supported quantum key distribution (QKD) verifications [7] [13] and optical channel characterization [9]. Methods for analysis, characterization and assessment of trends and performances of the LCTs in space and OGS have been developed and implemented. The Long Term Performance Analysis (LTPA) enables the assessment of potential degradations and allows for an introduction of corresponding counter measures (i.e. parameter settings modifications) preventing from negative impact on operations and services [6] [10].

1023,Scopus,Abbasi et al. (2019),2019,Modelling methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy wetlands in India using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs),Water (Switzerland),"Paddy fields, which are shallow man-made wetlands, are estimated to be responsible for ~11% of the total methane emissions attributed to anthropogenic sources. The role of water use in driving these emissions, and the apportioning of the emissions to individual countries engaged in paddy cultivation, are aspects that have been mired in controversy and disagreement. This is largely due to the fact that methane (CH4) emissions not only change with the cultivar type but also regions, climate, soil type, soil conditions, manner of irrigation, type and quantity of fertilizer added-to name a few. The factors which can influence these aspects also encompass a wide range, and have origins in causes which can be physical, chemical, biological, and combinations of these. Exceedingly complex feedback mechanisms, exerting different magnitudes and types of influences on CH4 emissions under different conditions, are operative. Similar is the case of nitrous oxide (N2O); indeed, the present level of understanding of the factors which influence the quantum of its emission is still more patchy. This makes it difficult to even understand precisely the role of the myriad factors, less so model them. The challenge is made even more daunting by the fact that accurate and precise data on most of these aspects is lacking. This makes it nearly impossible to develop analytical models linking causes with effects vis a vis CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields. For situations like this the bioinspired artificial intelligence technique of artificial neural network (ANN), which can model a phenomenon on the basis of past data and without the explicit understanding of the mechanism phenomena, may prove useful. However, no such model for CH4 or N2O has been developed so far. Hence the present work was undertaken. It describes ANN-based models developed by us to predict CH4 and N2O emissions using soil characteristics, fertilizer inputs, and rice cultivar yield as inputs. Upon testing the predictive ability of the models with sets of data not used in model development, it was seen that there was excellent agreement between model forecasts and experimental findings, leading to correlations coefficients of 0.991 and 0.96, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.17 and 261.3, respectively, for CH4 and N2O emissions. Thus, the models can be used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions from all those continuously flooded paddy wetlands for which data on total organic carbon, soil electrical conductivity, applied nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, NPK, and grain yield is available. © 2019 by the authors.",,10.3390/w11102169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074361567&doi=10.3390%2fw11102169&partnerID=40&md5=172e4f85d17e07dcb173ad65381bfd41,Article
1024,Scopus,Zhang & Hong (2019),2019,Electric load forecasting by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise and support vector regression with quantum-based dragonfly algorithm,Nonlinear Dynamics,"Accurate electric load forecasting can provide critical support to makers of energy policy and managers of power systems. The support vector regression (SVR) model can be hybridized with novel meta-heuristic algorithms not only to identify fluctuations and the nonlinear tendencies of electric loads, but also to generate satisfactory forecasts. However, many such algorithms have numerous drawbacks, such as a low population diversity and trapping at local optima, which are problems of premature convergence. Accordingly, approaches to increase the accuracy of forecasting must be developed. In this investigation, quantum computing mechanism is used to quantamize dragonfly behaviors to enhance the searching effectiveness of the dragonfly algorithm, namely QDA. In addition, conducting the data preprocessing by the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is useful to improve the forecasting accuracy. Thus, a new electric load forecasting model, the CEEMDAN-SVRQDA model, that combines the CEEMDAN and hybridizes the QDA with an SVR model, is proposed to provide more accurate forecasts.

(2019),2019,Experimental demonstration of non-bilocality with truly independent sources and strict locality constraints,Nature Photonics,"The ongoing interest in creating a secure global quantum network culminated recently in the demonstration of transcontinental quantum communication1. There is a pressing need to examine the properties attached to a quantum network architecture from multiple perspectives, including physics foundations2, communication security3, the efficient use of resources and innovative technological applications4,5. Here, we present an experimental realization of a five-node quantum network, in which quantum sources at two nodes deliver entangled photon pairs to three measurement nodes. With relevant events between five nodes separated space-like, we demonstrate violation of the Bell inequality and bilocal inequality6, with the locality, measurement independence and quantum source independence loopholes closed simultaneously in a quantum network. This experimental realization may be valuable for the design and implementation of future quantum networks. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,10.1038/s41566-019-0502-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071513303&doi=10.1038%2fs41566-019-0502-7&partnerID=40&md5=d20fb43f96391f5d83b4d7a06471f0bd,Letter

(2019),2019,"Concentric FRET: A review of the emerging concept, theory, and applications",Methods and Applications in Fluorescence,"Concentric Förster resonance energy transfer (cFRET) is an emerging concept for single-vector multiplexed bioanalysis and imaging. It features a network of competitive and sequential energy transfer pathways, which, to date, has been assembled with a central semiconductor quantum dot (QD) and biomolecular linkers to multiple copies of multiple types of concentrically-arranged fluorescent dyes. In this review, we provide a first-hand account of the concept and development of cFRET, starting from its place in the broader context of FRET probes and assemblies. Topics of discussion include materials for cFRET, with a focus on the enabling properties of QDs and the ideal properties of nominal acceptor dyes; characterization and analysis of cFRET configurations via photoluminescence intensity, emission ratio, lifetime, and photobleaching measurements; semi-empirical modeling to determine the rates and efficiencies of competitive and sequential FRET pathways from overall quenching efficiencies; and archetypical examples of cFRET configurations and their application in bioanalysis and imaging. Most of the latter examples demonstrate multiplexed detection of protease activity or nucleic acid targets. Examples of atypical and cFRET-like configurations are also discussed, including those that utilize time-gated FRET relays and charge-transfer quenching. We conclude with a perspective on challenges and directions for future research with cFRET. Although still emerging as a method, many exciting opportunities in bioanalysis, imaging, and beyond are envisioned for cFRET. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,10.1088/2050-6120/ab2b2f,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070791687&doi=10.1088%2f2050-6120%2fab2b2f&partnerID=40&md5=420a2df5989d44e723fe202ebe399a7c,Article

In previous demonstrations, carefully designed optical elements are used to convert left- and right-circular polarizations into plasmonic vortices with different topological charges, resulting in conversion from optical spin angular momentum (SAM) to plasmonic OAM. Here, it is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that by utilizing the near-field coupling between paired resonators in a metasurface, selective conversion from optical SAM to plasmonic OAM is realized, where generation of plasmonic vortices can be achieved for incident light of one circular polarization while significantly suppressed for the other circular polarization.

A computationally efficient hybrid approach for quantum simulations of ballistic GNRFETs is developed herein. The proposed simulation method is based on solving the two-dimensional (2D) Poisson equation using both wavelet-based adaptive meshing and wavelet-based matrix compression techniques, self-consistently, with well-trained neural network models that imitate the mode-space (MS) nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) solver in generating the charge density. The results obtained by applying the hybrid approach show good agreement with NEGF simulations. Numerical experiments reveal that the developed simulation method can offer a speed-up of about one order of magnitude over the conventional MS NEGF approach.

The potential of these variational parametrizations has been supported by analytical and numerical evidence in controlled benchmarks. While approaching the end of the early research phase in this field, it becomes increasingly important to show how neural-network states perform for models and physical problems that constitute a clear open challenge for other many-body computational methods. In this paper, we start addressing this aspect, concentrating on a presently unsolved model describing two-dimensional frustrated magnets. Using a fully convolutional neural network model as a variational ansätz, we study the frustrated spin-1/2J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We demonstrate that the resulting predictions for both ground-state energies and properties are competitive with, and often improve upon, existing state-of-the-art methods. In a relatively small region in the parameter space, corresponding to the maximally frustrated regime, our ansätz exhibits comparatively good but not the best performance.

Due to the inherent complexity of fluidized bed process, theoretical and experimental approaches were adopted in the study. Quantum computational approach was employed to predict the thermodynamic feasibilities of the possible interactions in the process. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of carrier loading and its contribution to the pollutant removal. FESEM/EDX and FTIR analyses were used to investigate the changes on the surface of the carriers due to interaction with Fenton's reagent. The results of quantum analysis show that with ΔG = −0.3263052 kcal/mol, complex formation between SiO2 and H2O2 is highly feasible. This is attributed to the siloxane bridge (Si–O–Si) of the SiO2 network. The experimental results revealed that carrier loading has a positive effect on the process and more than 23% of the initial COD can be removed through adsorption. The fluidization process resulted in 20% higher COD removal compared to the conventional Fenton oxidation.

First, the quantum channel is constructed through the Hadamard and controlled-NOT operations. Then, Alice, David, and Charlie each perform the quantum measurements on their own qubits. To ensure that the original state can be prepared determinately, two algorithms are proposed to construct the measurement bases for Alice and David. Finally, Bob reconstructs the original state with several appropriate unitary operations on his qubits according to the measurement results of Alice, David, and Charlie. To demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme, a remote preparation example of an arbitrary two-qubit state with the scheme is given.

Higher-performance systems now remain impractical largely only because their algorithms are extremely computationally demanding. For optimal performance, an amount of computation that increases at an exponential rate both with the number of users and with the data rate of each user is often required. The base station's computational capacity is thus becoming one of the key limiting factors on wireless capacity.

Usually, a ""scanning-and-transmitting"" program is adopted to compensate physical parameter variations of devices, which can provide accurate compensation but may cost plenty of time in stopping and calibrating processes, resulting in reduced efficiency in key transmissions. Here, we propose to employ a well-known machine learning model, i.e., the long short-term memory network (LSTM), to predict those physical parameter variations in advance and actively perform real-time control on corresponding QKD devices. Experimentally, we take the phase-coding scheme as an example and run the LSTM-model-based QKD system for more than 10 days. Experimental results show that we can keep the same level of quantum-bit error rate as the traditional scanning-and-transmitting program by employing our machine learning method, but dramatically reducing the scanning time and resulting in significantly enhanced key transmission efficiency. Furthermore, our current machine learning model should also be applicable to other QKD systems using any coding scheme or QKD protocols and thus seems a very promising candidate in large-scale application of quantum communication networks in the near future. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.12.014059,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073650666&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevApplied.12.014059&partnerID=40&md5=616523a634ad43ed9a3a83a98f0da100,Article

Opening a new spectral window around the 2 μm wavelength withrecently developed hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber and a thulium-doped fiber amplifieris a promising solution to increase transmission capacity due to the low-loss and wide-bandwidth properties of these components at this wavelength band. However, as a key component, the performance of current high-speed photodetectors at the 2 μm wavelength is still not comparable with those at the 1.55 μm wavelength band, which chokes the feasibility of the new spectral window.

However, Hcd(t) term often takes a complicated form in higher-dimensional systems and is difficult to realize in experiment. Recently, the Floquet-engineered method was proposed to emulate the dynamics induced by Hcd(t) without the need for complex interactions in multi-qubit systems, which can accelerate the adiabatic process through the fast-oscillating control in the original Hamiltonian H0(t).

Firstly, the wind turbine, gas turbine, energy storage battery and load are integrated into a virtual power plant, and price-type demand response measures are implemented on the user side to improve the load curve. Then, aiming at maximizing the operating profit of the virtual power plant, the opportunity constraint model is used to describe the uncertainty of the wind turbine, load forecasting and internal power balance, and consider the operational constraints and network security constraints of each unit. The scheduling scheme is generated based on the reasonable control and coordination of the output of each component. Finally, the quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with inertia weight adaptive adjustment is used to solve the model.

Most of the time, hand-designed networks are responsible for this incredible success. However, this engineering process demands considerable time and expert knowledge, which leads to an increasing interest in automating the design of deep architectures. Several new algorithms have been proposed to address the neural architecture search problem, but many of them require significant computational resources. Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEA) have their roots on quantum computing principles and present promising results in respect to faster convergence. In this work, we propose Q-NAS (Quantum-inspired Neural Architecture Search): a quantum-inspired algorithm to search for deep neural architectures by assembling substructures and optimizing some numerical hyperparameters. We present the first results applying Q-NAS on the CIFAR-10 dataset using only 20 K80 GPUs for about 50 hours.

In particular, many applications have seen the shift from LEDs to laser diodes to make use of higher powers, higher bandwidths and increased transmission distances. Laser communication systems are well established, however there are applications where the ability to select a single emitted wavelength is highly desirable, such as quantum atomic clocks or in filtered communication systems. Distributed feedback (DFB) lasers have been realised emitting at a single wavelength where the grating structure is etched into the sidewall of the ridge. The main motivation in developing these lasers is for the cooling of ions in atomic clocks; however their feasibility for optical communications is also explored. Narrow linewidth lasers are desirable and this paper will explore how this is achieved. Data rates in excess of 1 Gbit/s have also been achieved in a directly modulated, unfiltered system.

This has triggered a new research field on quantum-safe methods, and those that rely on the application of quantum principles are commonly referred as quantum cryptography. The most mature development in the field of quantum cryptography is called Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). QKD is a key exchange primitive that can replace existing mechanisms that can become obsolete in the near future. Although QKD has reached a high level of maturity, there is still a long path for a mass market implementation. QKD shall overcome issues such as miniaturization, network integration and the reduction of production costs to make the technology affordable. In this direction, we foresee that QKD systems will evolve following the same path as other networking technologies, where systems will run on specific network cards, integrable in commodity chassis. This work describes part of our activity in the EU H2020 project CiViQ in which quantum technologies, as QKD systems or quantum random number generators (QRNG), will become a single network element that we define as Quantum Switch. This allows for quantum resources (keys or random numbers) to be provided as a service, while the different components are integrated to cooperate for providing the most random and secure bit streams. Furthermore, with the purpose of making our proposal closer to current networking technology, this work also proposes an abstraction logic for making our Quantum Switch suitable to become part of software-defined networking (SDN) architectures. The model fits in the architecture of the SDN quantum node architecture, that is being under standardization by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. It permits to operate an entire quantum network using a logically centralized SDN controller, and quantum switches to generate and to forward key material and random numbers across the entire network.

Parameterized quantum circuits (P QC) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative (e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a P QC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a P QC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time.

Quantum computers will break the algorithms used in our public key infrastructure and in our key exchange protocols, forcing a complete retooling of cryptography as we know it. Quantum key distribution is a physical layer technology immune to quantum or classical computational threats. However, it requires a physical substrate, and optical fiber has been the usual choice. Most of the time, it is used just as a point-To-point link for the exclusive transport of delicate quantum signals. Its integration in a realworld shared network has not been attempted so far. Here we show how the new programmable software network architectures, together with specially designed quantum systems, can be used to produce a network that integrates classical and quantum communications, including management, in a single, production-level infrastructure. The network can also incorporate new quantum-safe algorithms and use the existing security protocols, thus bridging the gap between today's network security and the quantum-safe network of the future. This can be done in an evolutionary way, without zero-day migrations and the corresponding upfront costs.

Even though there has been extensive theoretical research toward nanoscale MC, there are no examples of implemented nanoscale MC networks. The main reason for this lies in the peculiarities of nanoscale physics, challenges in nanoscale fabrication, and highly stochastic nature of the biochemical domain of envisioned nanonetwork applications. This mandates developing novel device architectures and communication methods compatible with MC constraints. To that end, various transmitter and receiver designs for MC have been proposed in the literature together with numerable modulation, coding, and detection techniques. However, these works fall into domains of a very wide spectrum of disciplines, including, but not limited to, information and communication theory, quantum physics, materials science, nanofabrication, physiology, and synthetic biology. Therefore, we believe it is imperative for the progress of the field that an organized exposition of cumulative knowledge on the subject matter can be compiled. Thus, to fill this gap, in this comprehensive survey, we review the existing literature on transmitter and receiver architectures toward realizing MC among nanomaterial-based nanomachines and/or biological entities and provide a complete overview of modulation, coding, and detection techniques employed for MC.

The need to represent numeric quantities using limited resources leads to digitization errors which must be taken into account. As a first step towards quantum simulations of realistic high-energy physics problems, we use ensembles of SU(2) lattice gauge fields generated with standard classical computing to explore the effects of digitizing elements of the gauge group to a finite set. We consider several methods for digitizing the group, finding the best performance from an action-preserving projection onto a mesh. Working in (3+1) dimensions, we find that using ∼7 (qu)bits to represent each SU(2) gauge link induces a digitization error of the order of 10% in short-distance observables and 2% in long-distance observables. Promisingly, our results indicate that each SU(2) gauge link can be represented by O(10) (qu)bits, from which we estimate that a 163SU(2) lattice could be simulated with no more than O(105) (qu)bits.

However, high-dimensional quantum states, qudits, constitute a richer resource for future quantum networks, exceeding the limitations imposed by the ubiquitous qubits. The generation and manipulation of such D-level systems have been improved over the last ten years, but their reliable transmission between remote locations remains the main challenge. Here, we show how a recent air-core fiber supporting orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes can be exploited to faithfully transmit D-dimensional states. Four OAM quantum states and their superpositions are created, propagated in a 1.2-km-long fiber and detected with high fidelities. In addition, three quantum-key-distribution protocols are implemented as concrete applications to assert the practicality of our results.

These qualities put time-bin encoding at the center of applications ranging from quantum state preparation through to quantum communications and information processing. One of the hallmarks of the scheme is that a nonlinear element has to be pumped with phase-coherent double-pulses, which can be achieved by using unbalanced interferometers [1], making their phase stability the key determinant of both state generation and analysis accuracy. However, the phase ambiguity arising from the periodicity of feedback signals [3], as well as the difficulty of stabilizing on interference maxima/minima, leave progress to be made in fiberbased interferometry for time-bin encodings. © 2019 IEEE.",,10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8872195,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074649274&doi=10.1109%2fCLEOE-EQEC.2019.8872195&partnerID=40&md5=e4a3c48c4e61bff4481cb3bb60be27c2,Conference Paper

Despite the recent progress in the generation of designer ultrafast light waveforms with OAM [4-6], up to now there is no evidence for the creation of pulses with time-dependent OAM in any spectral regime.

Radial basis function network (RBFN) is a type of feedforward network that capable of perform nonlinear approximation on unknown dataset.

Thus, with the increases in RBFN application, some problems and weakness of RBFN network is identified.

This paper describes the theory and application of quantum computing and cloning operators, and discusses the superiority of these theories and the feasibility of their optimization algorithms.This proposed improved RBFN (I-RBFN) that combined with cloning operator and quantum computing algorithm demonstrated its ability in global search and local optimization to effectively speed up learning and provides better accuracy in prediction results. Both the algorithms that combined with RBFN optimize the centers and spread value of RBFN. The proposed I-RBFN was tested against the standard RBFN in predictions.

To realize QKD for secure communications among multiple distant users, fiber-based QKD networks can be deployed with today's available technologies. Incorporating QKD into existing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) network infrastructure provides a practical way to reduce the difficulty and cost of QKD networking. Nonetheless, the costs of QKD nodes and QKD links are still considered as the major barriers to long-distance QKD network deployment in practice. In this work, we study how to minimize the cost of deploying QKD-over-WDM backbone networks. We introduce a general architecture of QKD-over-WDM backbone networks. A novel cost-oriented model is defined to elaborate the cost-minimized problem, in which various QKD network components including QKD transceivers, QKD auxiliary equipment for QKD backbone nodes and trusted repeater nodes (TRNs), and QKD links are considered. The physical-layer parameters such as secret-key rate, physical distance, and the layout of TRNs are also incorporated in our defined model. We develop an integer linear programming (ILP) model and a novel cost-efficient QKD networking (CEQN) heuristic algorithm to address the cost-minimized problem. The extensive simulations indicate that our proposed approaches are effective in reducing the cost of deploying QKD-over-WDM backbone networks, where the designed CEQN algorithm is efficient to demonstrate similar to the ILP model.

We determine whether common routing and switching IT network infrastructure, including its hardware and software components, have enough cryptographic agility to accommodate the change of cryptographic algorithms to the ones that do not exhibit vulnerability to quantum computing and to the ones that are compliant with National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B set of protocols. We pinpoint upstream or downstream impacts of a change in the encryption algorithms across various IT network infrastructure components in terms of effort required to accomplish this transition. This study is among the first studies that investigate quantum-resistance cryptographic from the hardware perspectives of routing and switching technologies using diffusion of innovation theory. The study integrates enterprise governance to meet the challenges presented by quantum-computing with a focus on cryptographic agility. We offer an enterprise architecture framework for assessing the dependencies, costs, and benefits of IT infrastructure migration plan to meet the future challenges of quantum-resistant cryptographic. The analysis in this research can be used by IT managers to pre-plan for an upgrade of routing and switching infrastructure, assist in estimating the efforts required to perform these upgrades, and assist in selecting a vendor of routing and switching equipment from the perspective of cryptographic agility. With today's supercomputers, a computational task involved in breaking modern asymmetric cryptographic algorithms would be infeasible due to the required computational complexity.

However, with an exponential increase in the usage of IoT technologies, we have been witnessing an increase in the number of cyber attacks on the IoT environment. An adversary can capture the private key shared between users and devices and can launch various attacks, such as IoT ransomware, Mirai botnet, man-in-the-middle, denial of service, chosen plaintext, and chosen ciphertext. To mitigate these security attacks on the IoT environment, the traditional public key cryptographic primitives are inadequate because of their high computational and communication costs. Therefore, lattice-based public-key cryptosystem (LB-PKC) is a promising technique for secure communication. We discuss the taxonomy of two major problems, namely, the shortest path and the closest path problems with respect to the applicability of lattice-based cryptographic primitives for IoT devices. Moreover, we also discuss various LB-PKC techniques, such as NTRU, learning with errors (LWEs), and ring-LWE (R-LWE) which are often used to solve shortest path and lattice NP-hard problems in a polynomial time. We further classify the R-LWE into three categories, namely identity-based encryption, homomorphic encryption, and secure authentication key exchange. We describe the operations and algorithms adopted in each of these encryption mechanisms.

We first place our approach in its historical context and describe the manner in which it synthesizes concepts from quantum chemistry, biology of polymer conformations, matrix mathematics, and percolation theory. We then explicitly provide the method for constructing the protein structure network in terms of noncovalently interacting amino acid side chains and show how a mine of information can be obtained from the graph spectra of these networks. Employing suitable mathematical approaches, such as the use of a weighted, Laplacian matrix to generate the spectra, enables us to develop rigorous methods for network comparison and to identify crucial nodes responsible for the network integrity through a perturbation approach. Our scoring methods have several applications in structural biology that are elusive to conventional methods of analyses. Here, we discuss the instances of (a) protein structure comparison that includes the details of side chain connectivity, (b) contribution to node clustering as a function of bound ligand, explaining the global effect of local changes in phenomena such as allostery, and (c) identification of crucial amino acids for structural integrity, derived purely from the spectra of the graph. We demonstrate how our method enables us to obtain valuable information on key proteins involved in cellular functions and diseases such as GPCR and HIV protease and discuss the biological implications.

As a result, the crystalline C 60 fibers can be modulated to as long as 70 mm and 70 000 in their length-to-width ratio.

The as-prepared TiO 2 , ZnO/TiO 2 and CdS/ZnO/TiO 2 films were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV–vis absorption spectrum and EIS techniques to investigate the effects of ZnO NRs and CdS QDs on the structure, morphology, optical property and charge carrier transmission characteristics. The results demonstrated that the growth of ZnO NRs obviously enlarges the specific surface area, while the deposition of CdS QDs significantly enhances the light harvesting ability. And the heterojunctions formed among TiO 2 NSs, ZnO NRs and CdS QDs effectively promote the photogenerated charge carrier transport and separation, simultaneously inhibit the photogenerated electron-hole recombination. Moreover, it is notable that ZnO NRs trend to grow on the low-energy {101} facets of TiO 2 NSs due to the impact of crystal facet controlling agent, which can effectively shorten the electron conduction path-ways and facilitate the photogenerated electron-hole separation due to the lower band edge position of {101} facets than that of {001} facets. As a result, the photocurrent density of the optimized CdS/ZnO/TiO 2 composite film enhances to an excellent value of 12.1 mA/cm 2 at a potential of 0 V vs SCE, which is more than 27 times higher than that of bare TiO 2 NSs films.

However, the exponential decay of correlation in MPSs restricts its representation power heavily for modeling complex data such as natural images. In this work, we push forward the effort of applying tensor networks to machine learning by employing the tree tensor network (TTN), which exhibits balanced performance in expressibility and efficient training and sampling. We design the tree tensor network to utilize the two-dimensional prior of the natural images and develop sweeping learning and sampling algorithms which can be efficiently implemented utilizing graphical processing units. We apply our model to random binary patterns and the binary MNIST data sets of handwritten digits. We show that the TTN is superior to MPSs for generative modeling in keeping the correlation of pixels in natural images, as well as giving better log-likelihood scores in standard data sets of handwritten digits. We also compare its performance with state-of-the-art generative models such as variational autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines, and PixelCNN.

For heralded loss, SPF is shown to generate optimally loss-tolerant measurement patterns on any given stabilizer state. Furthermore, SPF also provides highly loss-tolerant teleportation strategies when qubit loss is unheralded. We provide a fast algorithm for SPF that updates continuously as a state is generated and measured, which is therefore suitable for real-time implementation on a quantum-computing device. When compared to simulations of previous heuristics for loss-tolerant teleportation on graph states, SPF provides considerable gains in tolerance to both heralded and unheralded loss, achieving a near-perfect teleportation rate (>95%) in the regime of low qubit loss (<10%) on various graph state lattices. Using these results we also present evidence that points towards the existence of loss-tolerant thresholds on such states, which in turn indicates that the loss-tolerant behaviour we have found also applies as the number of qubits tends to infinity. Our results represent a significant advance towards the realistic implementation of teleportation in both large-scale and near-future quantum architectures that are susceptible to qubit loss, such as linear optical quantum computation and quantum communication networks. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,10.1088/2058-9565/aaf6c4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070542386&doi=10.1088%2f2058-9565%2faaf6c4&partnerID=40&md5=6a34b25e1f34a4b5df7e95dabad75cb2,Article

High-dimensional encoding in the arrival time of photons is used to increase the information per coincidence of photon pairs. The bin sifting process is optimized by a three-level structure, which significantly reduces the raw quantum bit error rate (QBER) due to timing jitters of detectors and electronics. A raw key generation rate of 151 kbps with a QBER of 4.95% is achieved, in a time bin encoding format with 4 bits per coincidence.

Their properties, combined with their hydrogen bond - rich bulk nanostructures make them attractive alternatives as molecular solvents for a range of applications. Nevertheless, the solvation structure of molecular and polymer solvents in choline chloride DES remains largely uncharacterised due to the complexity of the DES nanostructure itself. We present a systematic quantum chemical investigation of the solvation structure of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEO) in DES formed by ChCl and urea, ethylene glycol and glycerol hydrogen bond donors. Trends in the solvation structure of PEO correlate with the density of the DES hydrogen bond network, and the extent to which this network can be perturbed by the polymer solute. We show that both of these factors are modulated by the type of hydrogen bond donor itself. Notably, PEO disrupts the urea – choline hydrogen bond network. This disruption leads to a more highly structured solvation environment for the polymer, which is forced into a relatively constrained, coiled morphology. By contrast, the disruption to the hydrogen bond networks in the ethylene glycol and glycerol DES are less significant, leading to a less constrained environment. © 2019",,10.1016/j.molliq.2019.02.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061236760&doi=10.1016%2fj.molliq.2019.02.004&partnerID=40&md5=7eb065ca7ee7d01782f1274b4a9276cf,Article

Thus, green energy and environment technologies have been the urgent and important areas. Among several possible alternatives for fossil energy, eventually solar energy is probably the only one that can meet the multifold demand for long-term human needs. The utilization of solar energy consists of two steps: First, solar energy can be effectively converted to applicable forms (electricity or fuel) from solar power to suppress energy crisis and global warming. Aiming at this goal, solar cells and photocatalysts for production of H2 and reduction of CO2 are mostly concerned. Second, high-performance energy storage devices are also required. This is mainly due to the intermittent characteristics of solar energy and other renewable energy sources. Supercapacitor is one of the promising devices for this purpose. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are interdisciplinary fields that bring together physicists, chemists, materials scientists, biochemists, and engineers to meet the challenges that humankind faces. Among the current subjects in nanoscience and nanotechnology, nanomaterials are developing fast and explosively and attract a huge amount of attention. Nowadays, a variety of nanomaterials have been employed to solve the energy and environmental problems. Among them, graphene, a single layer of two-dimensional network of hexagonal structured sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, has shown many unique properties, such as the quantum Hall effect, high carrier mobility at room temperature, large theoretical specific surface area, good optical transparency, high Young's modulus, and excellent thermal conductivity. Furthermore, it has high chemical stability and can be produced in a low-cost, controlled, scalable, and reproducible manner.

High-dimensional and multiparticle entanglement,Physical Review A,"Quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum information processes, such as quantum computation and quantum communication. Experiments in laboratories are unquestionably crucial to increase our understanding of quantum systems and inspire new insights into future applications. However, there are no general recipes for the creation of arbitrary quantum states with many particles entangled in high dimensions. Here we exploit a recent connection between quantum experiments and graph theory and answer this question for a plethora of classes of entangled states. We find experimental setups for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, W states, general Dicke states, and asymmetrically high-dimensional multipartite entangled states. This result sheds light on the producibility of arbitrary quantum states using photonic technology with probabilistic pair sources and allows us to understand the underlying technological and fundamental properties of entanglement. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032338,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064059864&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.99.032338&partnerID=40&md5=3b484837c32694161c10ac5dd76a70cc,Article

Specifically, significant progress has been made in the field of hybrid mechanical devices, in which a qubit is coupled to a mechanical oscillator. High cooperativity in such devices has been demonstrated with superconducting qubits, and coupling defect qubits to mechanical elements via crystal strain has enabled novel methods of qubit measurement and control. In this paper we demonstrate the fabrication of diamond optomechanical crystals (OMCs) with embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, a preliminary step toward reaching the quantum regime with defect qubit hybrid mechanical devices. We measure optical and mechanical resonances of diamond OMCs as well as the spin coherence of single embedded NV centers. We find that the spin has long coherence times T2∗=1.5 μs and T2=72 μs despite its proximity to nanofabricated surfaces.

This scheme is assisted with the semi-honest third party to fulfill the task. And the genuine two-photon hyperentangled Bell states are utilized as the important information carriers. Different from the previous protocols, this hyperentangled Bell states are composed of only two photons but characterize six qubits in two longitudinal momentum and polarization degrees of freedom (DOFs). In addition, this protocol possesses a higher information capacity and saves massive quantum resources for that the two-photon system can carry 6 bits of information. Meanwhile, this scheme can be applied and useful for long-distance quantum communication to improve the feasibility of QPC protocol. Furthermore, 64 nonorthogonal single-photon states as decoy photons are utilized to detect the security of the quantum channel. This method not only increases the security of the quantum channel, but also decreases the decoherence effect of environment noise. Moreover, this QPC protocol is analyzed to be immune to various kinds of attack. Finally, this QPC protocol can obtain the good application to compare the secret inputs securely, efficiently and feasibly.

(2019),2019,Multi-tenant provisioning over software defined networking enabled metropolitan area quantum key distribution networks,Journal of the Optical Society of America B: Optical Physics,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) has potential to provide long-term security for communications across the Internet. As security-hungry applications dramatically rise nowadays, a growing number of QKD networks are promising to be deployed in the immediate future. Nevertheless, a high-security-demand institution (e.g., a bank) needs to pay a high price to deploy its dedicated QKD network, while a cost-effective way of overcoming this challenge is to make multiple tenants share a QKD network. Each tenant represents a high-security-demand institution and can obtain secret keys on demand from the QKD network infrastructure for security purposes. Hence, how to achieve efficient and flexible multi-tenant provisioning over a QKD network becomes a crucial problem. This work introduces software defined networking (SDN) to address this problem. We experimentally demonstrate multi-tenant provisioning (including tenant establishment, adjustment, and deletion) over SDN-enabled metropolitan area QKD networks. A SDN-enabled metropolitan area QKD network architecture is introduced. We present a workflow, protocol extensions, and an on-demand secret-key resource allocation strategy for multi-tenant provisioning, which are all demonstrated by establishing an experimental testbed in the lab. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and flexibility of our SDN-based approaches for multi-tenant provisioning over metropolitan area QKD networks.

When direct communication is not possible, QKD is performed over fiber cables, but the imperfections in detectors used at the receiver side and also the material properties of fiber cables limit the long-distance communication. Free space-based QKD is free from such limitations and can pave the way for satellite-based quantum communication to set up a global network for sharing secret messages. To implement free space optical links, it is essential to study the effect of atmospheric turbulence. Here, an analysis is made for satellite-based quantum communication using QKD protocols. We assume two specific attacks, namely PNS (photon number splitting) and IRUD (intercept-resend with unambiguous discrimination), which could be main threats for future QKD-based satellite applications. The key generation rates and the error rates of the considered QKD protocols are presented. Other parameters such as optimum signal and decoy states mean photon numbers are calculated for each protocol and distance. Further, in SARG04 QKD protocol with two decoy states, the optimum signal-state mean photon number is independent of the link distance and is valid for the attacks considered here.

Herein, a high-brightness InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) nanoemitter array with an ultrahigh resolution of 31 750 dpi was achieved by combining a top-down fabrication with surface passivation of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD)-grown AlN coating. With regard to the nanometer-level top-down etching, the surface damage or defects on the newly-formed sidewall play a significant role in the photoluminescence (PL) quality. Note that these arrays can be effectively passivated by the PEALD-grown AlN coating with an over 345% PL enhancement. In addition, a sharp band bending at the interface of the luminescent InGaN QW and the AlN coating layer can electrically drift away the photogenerated electrons from the surface traps; this leads to enhancement of the bulk PL radiative recombination with a fast PL decay rate. Therefore, we have demonstrated a feasible way for realizing an advanced nanoemitter array with both high brightness and ultrahigh resolution for future smart displays, high-resolution imaging, big-data optical information systems and so on. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/c8nr07946c,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061988943&doi=10.1039%2fc8nr07946c&partnerID=40&md5=9a9153ba404f943e2392fff246cdf3d6,Article

However, the main challenge of the SQCC protocol is its low tolerance of phase noise, limiting the transmission distance under the real local oscillator (LO) design. To eliminate the phase drift without the aid of the reference signal, the classical carrier phase estimation (CPE) algorithm in the field of coherent optical communication is employed for phase recovery and data extraction. Besides, the power of the residual phase noise in classical communication and the power of the excess phase noise in CV-QKD are derived, including the effects of the employed laser linewidth, the transversal filter length, and the classical signal power. On this basis, the performances of the SQCC protocol under the trusted and the untrusted phase noise model are discussed, respectively.

Here, an approach to control terahertz (THz) near-field plasmonic vortex based on geometric and dynamic phase is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. By locally tailoring the orientation angle (geometric phase) and radial position (dynamic phase) of aperture arrays embedded in an ultrathin gold film, the excited surface waves can be flexibly engineered to form both spin-independent and spin-dependent THz plasmonic vortex field distributions, resulting in multi-degree of freedom for controlling OAM of THz surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Arbitrary OAM values of THz plasmonic vortex and coherent superposition between two OAM states are investigated based on near-field scanning terahertz microscopy (NSTM) system.

Given the high cost and difficulty of deploying QKD networks, multi-tenancy becomes promising to improve cost efficiency for future QKD networks. In a multi-tenant QKD network, multiple QKD tenants can share the same QKD network infrastructure to obtain secret keys for securing their data transfer. Since the secret-key resources are finite and precious in QKD networks, how to achieve efficient multi-tenant secret-key assignment (MTKA) to satisfy the secret-key demands of multiple QKD tenants over QKD networks becomes a significant problem. In this regard, this study addresses the MTKA problem over QKD networks. A new multi-tenant QKD network architecture is proposed based on software defined networking (SDN) and quantum key pool (QKP) techniques. A secret-key rate sharing scheme is presented and a heuristic algorithm is designed to implement efficient MTKA over QKD networks. A new performance metric, namely matching degree (MD) that reflects the balance between QKD network secret-key resources and QKD tenant requests, is defined and evaluated. Simulation studies indicate that high QKD tenant requests accommodation and efficient secret-key resource usage can be achieved via maximizing the value of MD. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",,10.1364/OE.27.002544,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060992747&doi=10.1364%2fOE.27.002544&partnerID=40&md5=782ac8ad39992fac07d373af1de37d80,Article

Theoretical and experimental studies on the phase estimation have been widely reported, while two frequency-locked laser sources are indispensable to achieve quantum coherent detection. Moreover, the self-referenced phase estimation scheme requires to propagate the strong reference pulse through optical fiber, which opens a security loophole through the manipulation of the reference pulse amplitude. Based on the theoretical security and Bayes’ theorem, we propose a phase estimation protocol, which does not require propagating the strong reference pulse for performing phase estimation. Compared to the other related work, the protocol can avoid the security problem caused by strong reference pulse.

1137,Scopus,Manukian et al. (2019),2019,Accelerating deep learning with memcomputing,Neural Networks,"Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their extensions, often called “deep-belief networks”, are powerful neural networks that have found applications in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The standard way to train these models resorts to an iterative unsupervised procedure based on Gibbs sampling, called “contrastive divergence”, and additional supervised tuning via back-propagation. However, this procedure has been shown not to follow any gradient and can lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we show an efficient alternative to contrastive divergence by means of simulations of digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) that compute the gradient of the log-likelihood involved in unsupervised training. We test our approach on pattern recognition using a modified version of the MNIST data set of hand-written numbers. DMMs sample effectively the vast phase space defined by the probability distribution of RBMs, and provide a good approximation close to the optimum. This efficient search significantly reduces the number of generative pretraining iterations necessary to achieve a given level of accuracy in the MNIST data set, as well as a total performance gain over the traditional approaches. In fact, the acceleration of the pretraining achieved by simulating DMMs is comparable to, in number of iterations, the recently reported hardware application of the quantum annealing method on the same network and data set. Notably, however, DMMs perform far better than the reported quantum annealing results in terms of quality of the training. Finally, we also compare our method to recent advances in supervised training, like batch-normalization and rectifiers, that seem to reduce the advantage of pretraining. We find that the memcomputing method still maintains a quality advantage (>1% in accuracy, corresponding to a 20% reduction in error rate) over these approaches, despite the network pretrained with memcomputing defines a more non-convex landscape using sigmoidal activation functions without batch-normalization. Our approach is agnostic about the connectivity of the network. Therefore, it can be extended to train full Boltzmann machines, and even deep networks at once. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.neunet.2018.10.012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056811877&doi=10.1016%2fj.neunet.2018.10.012&partnerID=40&md5=bda57c78bdbd448b39d9684dad2da2cd,Article

Commercial polysiloxane-based, ""silicone"" elastomers are generally intractable, which makes the precise characterization of their networks problematic.

1146,Scopus,Grable (2019),2019,LAWS OF PHYSICAL TIME,Laws of Physical Time,"Physics leaves big questions unanswered. For example, why does time seem to move only from the past toward the future? In fact, there is no good definition of past, present, and future. Experiments show there is no universal “flowing river of time.” Is time “the fourth dimension?"" Is there a “place” we can visit called “the past?"" Is there no unifying theory to join the theories of quantum mechanics and relativity? The nature of time is critical in answering these questions. Physics is not wrong - simply incomplete. More facts have been learned about our universe in the last thirty years than have been learned in all of previous history. Mostly what has been learned is how little we actually know. The nature of time is a good example. This book describes experiments that have proved that gravity, velocity, and acceleration slow time. Analysis shows that (1) perception of distance and time depends on relative velocity, (2) time can slow and stop, (3) time gets really strange near black holes, (4) photons traveling toward each other at the speed of light see the other moving only at the speed of light, due to time effects; and there are other strange effects. The truth is that most time experiment results have no real explanation. In physics there is no good definition for time and no logic foundation for a definition of time - until this book. Enter the new science and technology of time. Here the relatively new sciences of computer technology and communication theory have an important contribution to make. At the heart of the science we find the computer logic of state machines and the physical structure of information as a physical entity. In this world, “state change” is the pivot around which the world turns. We learn that logic is essential for understanding how time works. We discover how state change is essential for the very existence of time! Logic symbols provide a framework for thought about time. We even find a basis for some of the definitions physics has been searching for. We find an information-based state- transition-based definition of time. There is a way to define past, present, and future. In this book we find very compelling motivation for some interesting conclusions. For example, time is essentially the result of state transitions. If nothing happens, there is no evidence of time passing. We find that energy exchange motivates time. There is no experience of time without sequence of events. Could the new science and technology of time be the next leap forward in physics? Many current science writers seem to think so. (Imprint: Nova). © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

An action-value Q-function encodes the discounted value of moving a defect to a neighboring site on the square grid (the action) depending on the full set of defects on the torus (the syndrome or state). The Q-function is represented by a deep convolutional neural network. Using the translational invariance on the torus allows for viewing each defect from a central perspective which significantly simplifies the state space representation independently of the number of defect pairs. The training is done using experience replay, where data from the algorithm being played out is stored and used for mini-batch upgrade of the Q-network. We find performance which is close to, and for small error rates asymptotically equivalent to, that achieved by the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching algorithm for code distances up to d = 7.

1150,Scopus,Shapshak (2019),2019,"Astrovirology, astrobiology, artificial intelligence: Extra-solar system investigations",Global Virology III: Virology in the 21st Century,"This chapter attempts to encompass and tackle a large problem in Astrovirology and Astrobiology. There is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely, the just-right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system, galaxy, and the rest of the universe. Moreover, when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life, it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least, the important, if not crucial components of terrestrial life so that life then blooms, when their fragments cruise the solar system, stars, and galaxies, and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons. It is no longer extraordinary to detect extraterrestrial solar systems. Moreover, since extra-solar system space exploration has commenced, this provides the problem of detecting life with enhanced achievability. Small organisms, which replicate outside of a living cell or host, would not be catalogued as viruses. How about viruses that cohabit with life? On the Earth, viruses are a major, if underestimated, condition of life – will that be the case elsewhere? Detection of extra-solar system viruses, if they exist, requires finding life, since viruses necessitate life to replicate. (It should be noted, though, that viruses could be detected through various types of portable ultra-microscopes, including Electron Microscopes (EM) (scanning and transmission) as well as Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM).) However, extra-solar system detection of life does not oblige that viruses exist ubiquitously. Viruses are important potential components of biospheres because of their multiple interactions and influence on evolution, although viruses are small and obligatory parasitic. In addition, nanotechnology – living or replicating nano-synthetic machine organisms might also be present out there, and require consideration as well. An imposing caveat is that, if found, could some extraterrestrial viruses and synthetic nanotechnological microorganisms infect humans? Possibly, intelligence and cognition may at times be contemporaneous with life. Concomitantly, life and viruses that may be detected, could well be impacted upon by intelligences existing on such exoplanets (and vice versa). Coming to an understanding of the plurality of extraterrestrial intelligence is an optimal objective, in order to avoid causing harm on exoplanets, as well as avoiding conflict and possible human devastation. This is especially the case if we encounter greatly advanced galactic-level civilizations, compared to terrestrial civilizations. Their machine and bionic technologies on the Dyson engineering civilization scale may be prominently superior to ours; their biological expertise may be similarly critically radical. For example, they may use viruses for purposes for which we are barely aware, and which could be utterly deadly for humans. A series of steps is being taken in space exploration. Scientists hypothesize and claim that types of life may be near the Earth, in the solar system, and outside the solar system, similar to ours in the sense that only such conditions, Goldilocks conditions, are key sine qua non requirements, based on our terrestrial chemistry and biochemistry. If detected within the solar system, will life or its remnants resemble terrestrial life? Outside the solar system a similar chauvinism exists, although the likelihood for life, in any event, remains probably low, according to more cautious approaches to the problem. The study of our solar system includes planets, asteroids, comets, and other planetesimals that have been in overall contiguity during several billion years; anthropomorphisms claims life consequently has been developing along terrestrial-type mechanisms. However, a non-anthropomorphic view would surmise, probably not, especially for extra-solar system locales. The prime warning and admonition in all these deliberations is the contamination and damage, which current and past practice and procedures has caused and continues, due to insufficient biocontainment concepts and technology to date. Advances in the development of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high capacity ultrafast quantum computers (QC) greatly enhance the sophisticated control and logical development of extra-solar system studies. Consequently, future long-range manned space exploration seems unwarranted. Clearly, reduced dangers to human health and safety, will result from the use of intelligent machine-based investigations and besides, with increased cost-effectiveness. Space exploration comes at great cost to humanity as a whole and utilizes global resources. Consequently, appropriate organizational measures and planning/cooperation need to be in place. Moreover, the bottom line is that despite all the slogans and claims, there have been next to no financial benefits to our planet as a whole. Such financial and heedless difficulties need to be addressed, the sooner the better. In addition, prior to exposure to exoplanetary life, deep understanding of the problems of infectious diseases and immune dysfunction risks are needed. In addition, global efforts should avoid serendipity and stochasticity as this work should be directed with long-term organization, commitment, scientific, and technological methodology. This chapter briefly reviews such questions assuming a new paradigm for oversight of extrasolar system viral investigations including intelligence and life.

Qubits encoded in so-called 'time-bins', allowing a discrete superposition of two potential arrival times, have their entanglement preserved even over long propagation distances in standard fiber networks [1]. Time has also been used for the preparation of more complex quantum systems, such as hyper-entangled and cluster states [2]. These qualities put time-bin encoding at the center of applications ranging from quantum state preparation through to quantum communications and information processing. One of the hallmarks of the scheme is that a nonlinear element has to be pumped with phase-coherent double-pulses, which can be achieved by using unbalanced interferometers [1], making their phase stability the key determinant of both state generation and analysis accuracy. However, the phase ambiguity arising from the periodicity of feedback signals [3], as well as the difficulty of stabilizing on interference maxima/minima, leave progress to be made in fiber-based interferometry for time-bin encodings. © 2019 IEEE",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084616087&partnerID=40&md5=2ae639e3f7d3d8f81b937a43a7624987,Conference Paper

Traditional studies based on density functional theory (DFT) in physics are proved to be time-consuming for predicting large number of molecules. Recently, the machine learning methods, which consider much rule-based information, have also shown potentials for this issue. However, the complex inherent quantum interactions of molecules are still largely underexplored by existing solutions. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and transferable Multilevel Graph Convolutional neural Network (MGCN) for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we represent each molecule as a graph to preserve its internal structure. Moreover, the well-designed hierarchical graph neural network directly extracts features from the conformation and spatial information followed by the multilevel interactions. As a consequence, the multilevel overall representations can be utilized to make the prediction. Extensive experiments on both datasets of equilibrium and off-equilibrium molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, the detailed results also prove that MGCN is generalizable and transferable for the prediction. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

1160,Scopus,Slane (2019),2019,Future business models for space companies,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","This paper explores the evolution of the space company business model and suggests that future successful space companies will adopt open digitized architectures and use industry standards to optimize business opportunities and growth. Today in the space industry the ultimate customer is not a space company, but a terrestrial user of space data and information. Examples are easily identified as communications or remote sensing. Evolution in what is needed to support markets described in this paper are as a monolithic (vertically integrated) supply chain, a distributed, modular supply chain and, a near-term future space architecture and supply chain. Space companies have evolved over approximately the past two decades from monolithic architectures to distributed, modular architectures for purposes of flexibility, cost and growth opportunities. New Space economics puts added pressure on the industry to integrate with terrestrial capabilities. Future technologies will also drive greater integration with terrestrial capabilities. Original business models relied on integrated customers supplier relations for decades long development programs and multiple decade operations. Very high cost was justified by national needs, as was indemnification under government contracts. In the current space era new models exist because those factors have changed. While still costly, space services are coming to market with costs in the hundreds of millions of (US) dollars, not the billions of earlier solutions. Monolithic architectures have given way to more distributed modular concepts allowing for reduced costs over time. Insurance and industry standards use are significant additions to former practices. While struggling with these fundamental changes, global technological change continues unabated and will place greater additional pressure on space company business models due to blockchain technology and quantum computing together with associated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity.

(2019),2019,Fundamentally secure data with the help of quantum key distribution on CubeSats,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","With the uprise of worldwide satellite communication networks, data security is a critical issue. This issue is being addressed in the QUBE project, which proposes a CubeSat for quantum cryptography experiments. The satellite and its subsystems are currently being developed and will be used for the downlink of individual photons, or strongly attenuated light pulses, containing encoded quantum information, which can then be employed for the exchange of encryption keys. The launch of the 3U Nanosatellite is planned for early 2020. It will be built using the UNISEC-Europe standard, which has demonstrated to be able to provide a robust structure for increased reliability in CubeSat missions. In addition to state-of-the-art reaction wheels for precision pointing, the satellite will be bringing the OSIRIS optical downlink system from DLR as well as two dedicated payloads for testing components required for quantum key distribution. A sequence of numbers will be created by a miniaturized quantum random number generator (QRNG), which will be used to set the quantum states of the light pulses. These pulses will then be downlinked to the optical ground station (OGS) at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The ground station is also equipped with the corresponding components for receiving individual quantum states. In addition, the random numbers will be made available via an RF downlink. The photon states received by the optical ground station will then be compared to the previously generated numbers. Due to the underlying quantum mechanics, any attempt of reading the quantum states will alter them, which makes interceptions easily detectable. These quantum key distribution experiments will evaluate whether secure communication links are possible even on a CubeSat scale. A major challenge for building the proposed CubeSat is the attitude determination and control system that will provide precise pointing. This work will outline detailed mission requirements as well as the chosen subsystems for tackling these challenges in order to achieve a successful mission and prepare for future data security.

1162,Scopus,Hamilton et al. (2019),2019,Overview of NASA's national space quantum laboratory program,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","The development of entanglement-based quantum networks promises substantial benefit to quantum-enabled applications including distributed quantum sensing, improved timing/synchronization, multi-processor quantum computing over short-range interconnects, and distributed computing or secure communication over long-haul links. Photonic-based systems are the primary technology for realizing quantum networks due to the relative ease of photon transport while maintaining the quantum state. Significant development is required, however, to realize entanglement distribution rates commensurate with quantum network application requirements. In FY18, NASA initiated a hardware development program at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) to enable a series of near-term space-based quantum communication demonstrations that leverage the agency's significant investment in classical lasercom hardware pathfinders. Our program is focused on developing technology to enable entanglement-based quantum network demonstrations over satellite-based downlinks and crosslinks. Critical technology development underway today includes: precision synchronization, high-rate heralded entanglement sources and variable storage-time quantum memory. The ultimate goal of the program is to deploy this quantum communication infrastructure on the International Space Station to provide a National Space Quantum Laboratory (NSQL) that can be used collaboratively by the quantum information science research community to characterize new quantum technologies and evaluate new quantum system applications enabled by quantum states distributed over long distances. Quantum free-space communication links also require beam pointing, acquisition and tracking and a classical communication channel provided by RF or lasercom terminal technology. Today, MIT-LL is developing next-generation lasercom terminal hardware for NASA that will be used to demonstrate LEO-to-GEO bi-directional crosslinks and high-rate communications for Lunar downlinks. We envision that a near-term NASA free-space lasercom pathfinder will be leveraged to demonstrate NASA's first space quantum communication links. The Integrated LCRD Low-Earth Orbit User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T) program will host a next-generation lasercom terminal developed by MIT-LL on the International Space Station in the 2022 timeframe. The ILLUMA-T lasercom terminal integrated with a quantum modem can also be used to demonstrate high-rate space-to-ground entanglement distribution and explore the feasibility of dual-span ground-to-ground links and smallsat quantum crosslinks. In this presentation, we describe the objectives of NASA's NSQL quantum communications program and discuss key technologies employed in the space and ground terminals.

1163,Scopus,Iranmanesh et al. (2019),2019,System design trade off for a quantum channel between a Leo Cubesat and an optical ground station,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","Satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a fundamental enabler of next generation communications networks. By ensuring the secure distribution of cryptographic keys over globe-spanning distances, this technology enables a step increase in the capability to secure communications. Despite rapid progress in quantum key distribution research, the range of QKD methods are limited because of quantum states' sensitivity to system noise and transmission loss. As such, free space methods of transmission are preferred. Combined with the requirement to share keys across the globe for commercial applications, space-based links are therefore very attractive to extend the range of QKD. In-Orbit demonstration missions have proven the feasibility, at great expense, of creating a quantum channel between a payload in space and a ground station. However, a QKD solution can only be commercially viable if the space segment can be realised by affordable CubeSats as the transmitter node. This would require both the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) CubeSat and the ground station to meet challenging orientation and stability maintenance requirements in order to ensure the necessary end-to-end photon transmission performance. While many off-the-shelf solutions exist for CubeSat Ground stations in VHF, UHF and S-Bands, there are no turnkey optical ground station solutions that meet the challenging requirements for quantum channels with satellites in LEO. A demonstration programme with a single CubeSat and one ground station is in progress between STFC RAL Space and National University of Singapore (NUS). This paper reports the trade-off study between the pointing specifications of the ground station and the CubeSat platform. From a design point of view, the challenge is to optimise the system so that the requirements are balanced between the Space and Ground segments and that the overall combined cost is minimised, whilst respecting the power and mass budgets of the space segment. A concurrent design study (using STFC RAL Space's CDF facility) was undertaken for this assessment. AGI STK was additionally used for orbital analysis and assessment of the required pointing stability and rotation rates. A solution using a combination of coarse and fine pointing systems is proposed for the space segment, whilst keeping costs down for the ground segment, which allows for multiple ground segments to maximize availability for a demonstration mission. The paper also sets requirements for accurate pointing and reliable optical communications. Copyright © 2019 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), with its partner institutions, is pursuing a variety of technology endeavours to enable the practical application of quantum communications in future NASA missions. This paper will discuss some of those technology areas. We will discuss methods being developed by GSFC and the University of Kansas for securing and auto-synchronizing communication over free-space optics using quantum key distribution and chaotic systems. In such a scenario, the security of the system would stem from the sensitivity to initial conditions. Furthermore, specific windows of single chaotic runs can be harvested to be used with encoder/decoder in a cyclic manner. Not only would the security of such a system be unique, the initial conditions can be transmitted via a quantum key distribution to add another layer of security to the system. We will discuss work being performed by GSFC and Michigan State University in analysis and development of solid-state quantum communications materials and devices. These will be necessary for devices capable of processing and routing quantum information on-board a spacecraft or within a quantum-capable ground station. In recent years, advancements in the understanding of quantum properties has led to a wide range of promising applications. One such application is orbital angular momentum (OAM) for secure optical communications being researched by partners at University of Wyoming and University of Illinois-Chicago. The utilization of OAM properties can be done via highly precise function values that can then be modulated using different constellations. Opportunities for quantum communications demonstrations exists in a variety of possible venues from balloons to CubeSats.

Automatic identification system (AIS) is a maritime navigation safety communication system that operates in the very high frequency mobile band and was developed primarily for collision avoidance. Since AIS is a one-way communication system which does not need to consider the target echo signal, it can estimate the atmospheric refractivity profile more accurately. Estimating atmospheric refractivity profiles from AIS signal power is a complex nonlinear optimization problem, the QPSO algorithm is adopted to search for the optimal solution from various refractivity parameters, and the inversion results are compared with those of the particle swarm optimization algorithm to validate the superiority of the QPSO algorithm. In order to test the anti-noise ability of the QPSO algorithm, the synthetic AIS signal power with different Gaussian noise levels is utilized to invert the surface-based duct. Simulation results indicate that the QPSO algorithm can invert the surface-based duct using AIS signal power accurately, which verify the feasibility of the new atmospheric refractivity estimation method based on the automatic identification system. © 2019 B.

1169,Scopus,Moll et al. (2019),2019,Stratospheric QKD: Feasibility analysis and free-space optics system concept,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the most mature quantum technologies and can provide quantum-safe security in future communication networks. Since QKD in fiber is limited to a range of few hundred kilometers, one approach to bridge continental scale distances may be the use of high altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS) as mobile trusted nodes in the stratosphere. In parallel, free-space laser communication for high rate data transmission has been a subject of research and development for several decades and its commercialization is progressing rapidly. Important synergies exist between classical free-space communication and QKD systems since the quantum states are often implemented using the same degrees of freedom such as polarization or field amplitude and phase. These synergies can be used to benefit from the progress in classical free-space laser communication in QKD applications. In this paper, the use case of QKD in a stratospheric environment is described wherein HAPS may serve as relay station of secret keys and encrypted data. The mission scenario and HAPS capabilities are analyzed to derive special requirements on the stratospheric laser terminal, the link geometry and the ground segment with respect to a feasibility demonstration. To obtain a flexible and compatible system, discrete variable and continuous variable QKD protocols are considered to be implemented side by side in the HAPS payload. Depending on the system parameters, it can be beneficial to use the one or the other kind of protocol. Thus, a direct comparison of both in one and the same system is of scientific interest. Each of the protocols has particular requirements on coupling efficiency and implementation. Link budget calculations are performed to analyze possible distances, key rates and data transmission rates for the different schemes. In case of the QKD system, the mean coupling efficiency is of main interest, i.e. signal fluctuations arising from atmospheric turbulence must be taken into account in the security proof, but the buffered key generation relaxes real-time requirements. This is different to classical communications, where the corresponding fading loss must be assessed. A system architecture is presented that comprises the optical aircraft terminal, the optical ground terminal and the most important subsystems that enable implementation of the considered QKD protocols. The aircraft terminal is interfaced with the dedicated quantum transmitter module (Alice) and the ground station with the dedicated quantum receiver module (Bob). The optical interfaces are SMF couplings which put high requirements on the receiving optics, in particular the need for wave-front correction with adaptive optics.

(2019),2019,General Linear Group Action on Tensors: A Candidate for Post-quantum Cryptography,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Starting from the one-way group action framework of Brassard and Yung (Crypto’90), we revisit building cryptography based on group actions. Several previous candidates for one-way group actions no longer stand, due to progress both on classical algorithms (e.g., graph isomorphism) and quantum algorithms (e.g., discrete logarithm). We propose the general linear group action on tensors as a new candidate to build cryptography based on group actions. Recent works (Futorny–Grochow–Sergeichuk Lin. Alg. Appl., 2019) suggest that the underlying algorithmic problem, the tensor isomorphism problem, is the hardest one among several isomorphism testing problems arising from areas including coding theory, computational group theory, and multivariate cryptography. We present evidence to justify the viability of this proposal from comprehensive study of the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, theoretical algorithms, hardness results, as well as quantum algorithms. We then introduce a new notion called pseudorandom group actions to further develop group-action based cryptography. Briefly speaking, given a group G acting on a set S, we assume that it is hard to distinguish two distributions of (s, t) either uniformly chosen from S × S, or where s is randomly chosen from S and t is the result of applying a random group action of gεG on s. This subsumes the classical Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption when specialized to a particular group action. We carefully analyze various attack strategies that support instantiating this assumption by the general linear group action on tensors. Finally, we construct several cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures and pseudorandom functions. We give quantum security proofs based on the one-way group action assumption and the pseudorandom group action assumption. © 2019, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,10.1007/978-3-030-36030-6_11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077015734&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-36030-6_11&partnerID=40&md5=5a7c1ce2e044260b095ff3121fcab3ed,Conference Paper

Conversely, low-cost, power efficient laser transmitters (Tx) and receivers (Rx) for the MW-LWIR wavelengths are not as widely available as the 1.55 μm counterpart especially for high bandwidth. Larger aperture sizes are also likely required for MW-LWIR to maintain acceptable beam divergence and adequate receiver signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). All of these are challenges for the development of the MW-LWIR FSOC technology. In the framework of ARAP DOC-P program (Applied Research for the Advancement of S and T Priorities Defense Optical Channel Program), CCDC-ARL (Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory) has taken on the challenge to investigate and develop ground-to-space FSOC in the MW-LWIR regions with commensurate comparisons of MW-LWIR and SWIR systems. The effort started with a detailed literature survey on the MWIR and LWIR FSOC experiments and the latest progress. CCDC-ARL has conducted investigations of the state-of-the-art MWLWIR laser Tx and MW-LWIR photodetectors including in-house development. An FSOC ground testbed employing MW-LWIR COTS quantum cascade laser (QCL) sources is being developed. The Tx will be directly modulated using electronic circuits built in-house. In a collaborative effort with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), CCDC-ARL is testing a free-space link emulator based on 1.55 μm fiber optics components first developed by NRL. CCDC-ARL is also developing atmospheric beam propagation simulation tools based on random phase screens in order to gain insight and compare the performance envelope for MW-LWIR and SWIR. © 2019 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2530969,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076919766&doi=10.1117%2f12.2530969&partnerID=40&md5=a17230f759f67a81cdf86ee1240009eb,Conference Paper

However, concurrent improvements in the catalytic cycle and catalyst recovery remain elusive. Herein, we report the creation of a network array of G-quadruplex (G4)-hemin complexes crosslinked by carbon quantum dots (CDs) that not only significantly improves the G-quadruplex-hemin DNAzyme activity, stability, and catalytic cycle, but also points towards easy catalyst regeneration via a semi-heterogeneous catalysis approach. 5′-phosphate terminated G-rich single-stranded DNA molecules proficient in generating intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplexes were covalently conjugated to anthrarufin derived CDs through phosphoramidite chemistry. The network array was achieved through K+ mediated intermolecular G-quadruplex formation that readily complexes with hemin to give the catalytic core. The presence of CDs in close vicinity ensures a favorable microenvironment that helps in amplifying the DNAzyme activity in both the intermolecular CD-G-quadruplex network assembly and the intramolecular CD-G quadruplex conjugate, while the former is necessary for easy catalyst regeneration. The CD photophysics enable the monitoring of the DNAzyme recovery and reaction progress.

Fabry-Perot cavities especially, are a good candidate for these applications, thanks to a circular mode profile emission and low-lasing threshold. These properties are related to the small volume of the active region and the use of highly reflective Distributed Bragg mirrors (DBRs). The reflectance of the DBRs is related to the finesse of the cavity. In order to assure a strong coupling in the cavity, a high finesse is required and therefore a reflectivity value as high as 99.9999%. Achieving such a difficult goal faces many technical challenges and limiting parameters such as optical losses (scatter and absorption) and other limitations related to thin film coating technologies.

One of the most important challenges in WSNs is determining the operational mode of sensors, decreasing the energy consumption while the connectivity requirements and the special properties are satisfied. This problem is an NP-hard one and is a time–consuming progress. In this study, an improved version of quadrivalent quantum-inspired gravitational search algorithm as a new metaheuristic, well suitable for quadrivalent problems is proposed using Not Q-Gate to optimize the performance of the WSN. Beside, to enhance the speed and the accuracy of the algorithm more, we used a parallelizing technique using Open-MP. Parallelizing this algorithm on mentioned problem is useful from four aspects; 1 - accelerate the speed of the algorithm, 2 - improving the quality of solutions by letting the increasing the population size, 3 - The possibility of using the algorithm, in larger-scale WSNs and 4 - power affectivity of the base station using multicore processors. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, a comparison between this approach and the previous methods is performed. Our experiments verified that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance more than 2.25 times and the speedup faster than 4 times on an 8-core CPU. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-030-33495-6_27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075837899&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-33495-6_27&partnerID=40&md5=e767a21eb038c8cd3a3536106c29876e,Conference Paper

(2019),2019,Tunable quantum dot lasers grown directly on silicon,Optica,"Tunable semiconductor lasers are often listed in critical technology road maps for future dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) systems and high-performance computing systems, and they are increasingly demanded in long-haul, metropolitan, and access networks. The capability to produce such lasers directly on silicon (Si) could boost the use of Si photonics and facilitate the adoption of optical data transmission even at the chip scale. Moreover, just the use of Si as a cheap and large-diameter substrate for device production is very advantageous, as the fabrication can take advantage of the highly optimized processing techniques and economy of scale enabled by decades of development in Si microelectronics. Here, we report a tunable single-wavelength quantum dot (QD) laser directly grown on Si. The high carrier confinement and a real dot density of QDs provide reduced sensitivity to crystalline defects, which allows for exceptional lasing performance even in lattice-mismatched material systems. The discrete density of states of dots yields unique gain properties that show promise for improved device performance and new functionalities relative to the quantum well counterparts, including high temperature stability, low threshold operation, reduced sidewall recombination, and isolator-free stability. We implement a simple, integrable architecture to achieve over 45 dB side-mode-suppression-ratio without involving regrowth steps or subwavelength grating lithography. Under continuous-wave electrical injection at room temperature, we achieved a 16 nm tuning range with output powers of over 2.7 mW per tuning wavelength.

Prominent examples are hash functions for which collisions become known, or number-theoretic assumptions which are threatened by advances in quantum computing. Especially when it comes to key exchange protocols, the switch to quantum-resistant primitives has begun and aims to protect today’s secrets against future developments, moving from common Diffie–Hellman-based solutions to Learning-With-Errors-based approaches, often via intermediate hybrid designs. To this date there exists no security notion for key exchange protocols that could capture the scenario of breakdowns of arbitrary cryptographic primitives to argue security of prior or even ongoing and future sessions. In this work we extend the common Bellare–Rogaway model to capture breakdown resilience of key exchange protocols. Our extended model allows us to study security of a protocol even in case of unexpected failure of employed primitives, may it be number-theoretic assumptions, hash functions, signature schemes, key derivation functions, etc. We then apply our security model to analyze two real-world protocols, showing that breakdown resilience for certain primitives is achieved by both an authenticated variant of the post-quantum secure key encapsulation mechanism (Alkim et al.) which is a second round candidate in the Post Quantum Cryptography standardization process by NIST, as well as by TLS 1.3, which has recently been standardized as RFC 8446 by the Internet Engineering Task Force. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-030-29962-0_25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075599183&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-29962-0_25&partnerID=40&md5=d5371c10decfac3bd8ea39ba8fcb2911,Conference Paper

Although the future of WSNs is very prospective, the security issues become more and more important because they are used for very critical applications in engineering areas. Furthermore, they are very vulnerable and thus attractive to attacks because of human-unattended deployment and their limited prices. Generally, they are protected by public key cryptosystems. Such systems depends on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithms or integer factorizations. However, they can be attacked by Shor's algorithm on quantum computers. Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC) schemes are secure to attacks by quantum computers. Among such schemes, multivariate signatures use various multiplications in a finite field, which are time-consuming operations during signature generations. Thus, we focus on improving multiplications in finite fields for multivariate signatures. We propose a variant of Mastrovito multiplications based on trinomial, Special Trinomial (ST), pentanomial, Special Pentanomial (SP), Equally-spaced-polynomial (ESP), All-One-polynomial (AOP), and successive-one-polynomial (SOP).

Nevertheless, there are still many problems in the realistic scenario where QKD coexists with dynamic data traffics. On the one hand, the conventional static channel allocation schemes cannot guarantee the quality of quantum channels in the presence of the time-varying noises. On the other hand, considering the complex noise generation caused by dynamic classical data traffics with variable characters, it is challenging to achieve online high-performance quantum channel assignments. To address these problems, we propose a machine learning based noise-suppressing channel allocation (ML-NSCA) scheme. In this scheme, the LightGBM based ML framework is trained to predict the optimal channel allocations with lowest noise impacts, according to which, the quantum channels are periodically reallocated to guarantee high secure key rate. To improve the accuracy and scalability of the ML framework, we also optimize the method of feature extraction during the training process. The performance evaluation results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively resist the dynamic noise impacts in the realistic optical networks and obtain higher secure key rate with less operation complexity than the previous schemes. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",,10.1364/OE.27.031741,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074340987&doi=10.1364%2fOE.27.031741&partnerID=40&md5=9c04fed5e811e72e5d3a35d6bb3d7d93,Article

Previously, off-the-shelf GaN LDs have been reported with a view on free space and underwater communications. However, there are applications where the ability to select a single emitted wavelength is highly desirable, namely in atomic clocks or in filtered free-space communications systems. To accomplish this, Distributed Feedback (DFB) geometries are utilised. Due to the complexity of overgrowth steps for buried gratings in III-Nitride material systems, GaN DFBs have a grating etched into the sidewall to ensure single mode operation, with wavelengths ranging from 405nm to 435nm achieved. The main motivation in developing these devices is for the cooling of strontium ions (Sr+) in atomic clock applications, but their feasibility for optical communications have also been investigated. Data transmission rates exceeding 1 Gbit/s have been observed in unfiltered systems, and work is currently ongoing to examine their viability for filtered communications. Ultimately, transmission through Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is desired, to ensure that data is communicated more coherently and efficiently.

However, the design and fabrication of surface-charge-controllable nanochannels remain a scientific as well as a technological challenge. This study investigated the feasibility of graphene oxide (GO)-based fiber-type nanochannels for generating electrical energy by converting the salinity gradient. Owing to their large lateral size and the localized charged species on the edge, the low charge density of the GO fibers remains a critical bottleneck in their wider investigation. To address this critical issue, highly negatively charged and extremely small (2.42 ± 0.38 nm) graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were synthesized and intercalated through the interstitial network of GO sheets in fibers. With the application of GQDs, the charge density was significantly increased to 1.12 mC m-2 so that the ion conductance was enhanced to an average of 21 nS and the electrical energy generation was 0.25 W m-2.

In the past decade, especially in 2018, many materials and devices have been tested for properties related to VLC, such as fc, response time, and transmission data rates, which are listed and analyzed here to get an updated overall picture. The f-3 dB for the latest blue LED and color converter can reach up to 1485 and 470 MHz, respectively, which are great improvements from &lt; 5 MHz for conventional white LEDs. Among the new PDs, the largest characterized fc is 4.2 MHz. Moreover, the smallest response time of these PDs is 0.95 ns, which is promising to have fc of hundreds of megahertz. The limitation in the field of view when the active area is reduced to enlarge fc of the PD can be partially overcome with novel fluorescent antenna, whose fc is more than 40 MHz. These increments in the fc or f-3dB of hardware not only enlarge the channel capacity of the VLC but also facilitate the channel impulse response measurement, and the system becomes more susceptible to changes in the environment.

Our system consists of two directly coupled cavities, each coupled to a different waveguide. The system is pumped by a control field and a signal field propagating in the waveguides. We analyze the excitation spectra of the cavities, as well as corresponding transmission and reflection coefficients for the signal field. We find that induced transparency or an absorption phenomenon for the signal field can be established in this system, depending on the parameters of the control field. Thus, the transport properties for the signal field are highly controllable. Under appropriate parameters the system can behave as a nearly perfect optical switch for the signal field. The influence of dissipations on the efficiency of the switch is also discussed.

1191,Scopus,Kramer (2019),2019,A geometric description of feasible singular values in the tensor train format,SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications,"Tree tensor networks such as the tensor train (TT) format are a common tool for high-dimensional problems. The associated multivariate rank and accordant tuples of singular values are based on different matricizations of the same tensor. While the behavior of such is as essential as in the matrix case, here questions about the feasibility of specific constellations arise: which prescribed tuples can be realized as singular values of a tensor, and what is this feasible set? We first show the equivalence of the tensor feasibility problem (TFP) to the quantum marginal problem (QMP). In higher dimensions, in case of the TT-format, the conditions for feasibility can be decoupled. By present results for three dimensions for the QMP, it then follows that the tuples of squared, feasible TT-singular values form polyhedral cones. We further establish a connection to eigenvalue relations of sums of Hermitian matrices, which in turn are described by sets of interlinked, so-called honeycombs, as they have been introduced by Knutson and Tao. Besides a large class of universal, necessary inequalities as well as the vertex description for a special, simpler instance, we present a linear programming algorithm to check feasibility and a simple, heuristic algorithm to construct representations of tensors with prescribed, feasible TT-singular values in parallel. © 2019 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications.

(2019),2019,A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Defluorination of Per- And Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) for Their Efficient Treatment and Removal,Environmental Science and Technology Letters,"We present the first application of machine learning on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) for predicting and rationalizing carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond dissociation energies to aid in their efficient treatment and removal. Using a variety of machine learning algorithms (including Random Forest, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression, and Feed-forward Neural Networks), we were able to obtain extremely accurate predictions for C-F bond dissociation energies (with deviations less than 0.70 kcal/mol) that are within chemical accuracy of the PFAS reference data. In addition, we show that our machine learning approach is extremely efficient, requiring less than 10 min to train the data and less than a second to predict the C-F bond dissociation energy of a new compound. Most importantly, our approach only needs knowledge of the simple chemical connectivity in a PFAS structure to yield reliable results - without recourse to a computationally expensive quantum mechanical calculation or a three-dimensional structure. Finally, we present an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can automatically classify and rationalize chemical trends in PFAS structures that would otherwise have been difficult to humanly visualize or process manually. Collectively, these studies (1) comprise the first application of machine learning techniques for PFAS structures to predict/rationalize C-F bond dissociation energies and (2) show immense promise for assisting experimentalists in the targeted defluorination of specific bonds in PFAS structures (or other unknown environmental contaminants) of increasing complexity.

Since short-reach interconnect applications require many transmitters, cost and power consumption are significant issues. Directly modulated lasers with a wavelength-scale active volume will be used as optical interconnects on boards and chips in the future because a small active volume is expected to reduce power consumption. We developed electrically driven photonic crystal (PhC) lasers with a wavelength-scale cavity in which the active region is embedded in a line-defect waveguide of an InP-based PhC slab. We call this a λ-scale embedded active region PhC laser, or a LEAP laser. The device, whose active region has six quantum wells with 2.5 × 0.3 × 0.15 μm3 active volume, exhibits a threshold current of 28 μA and provides 10 fJ/bit of operating energy to 25 Gbit/s NRZ (non-return-to-zero) signals. The fiber-coupled output power is 6.9 μW. We also demonstrate heterogeneous integration of LEAP lasers on a SiO2/Si substrate for low-cost photonic integrated circuits (PICs).

Recently, hydrologists have shown interest in researching the effects of DEMs from different sources on simulated outputs. As part of these efforts, this study aimed at evaluating the effects of DEM and algorithm selection on geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrographs (GIUH)-Nash model based direct surface runoff predictions from ungauged Debarwa river catchment in Eritrea. Four open-source DEMs and two quantum geographic information system (QGIS) algorithms (GRASS and SAGA) were applied and corresponding outputs were evaluated using five observed events. The two algorithms resulted in drainage networks of similar stream orders but different geomorphologic characteristics such as stream ratios. The subjective and objective goodness of fit results indicated that the performance of the model based on SAGA was unsatisfactory whereas that of GRASS algorithm-based GIUH-Nash model was acceptable for all the DEM-scenarios irrespective of their sources and resolutions. The study concluded that DEM in the calculation of flow hydrographs for the conditions of the Debarwa catchment selection has little impact on the GIUH-Nash model based direct surface runoff predictions and can be used indiscriminately. But, great care should be taken while selecting stream network generating algorithms, especially for catchments whose outlets are located near the confluence of two major rivers. © 2019 St-Petersburg State Polytechnical University.

Multipliers are an important requirement in applications linked to Digital Signal Processing, Communication Systems, Optical Computing, Nanotechnology, Low-Power Very Large Scale Integration and Quantum Computing. Conventional mathematics makes multiplication a very long and time consuming process. The use of Vedic mathematics has led to great reduction in the time required for such calculations. The excessive use of Urdhava Tiryakbhyam sutra in multiplication surely proves its effectiveness and simplicity in this domain. This sutra supports the process of pipelining, a method employed in reduction of the power used by a system. Reversible logic has been gaining demand due to its low-power capabilities and is currently being used in many computing applications. The paper proposes two multiplier systems: one design employs the Urdhava Tiryakbhyam sutra along with pipelining and the second uses reversible logic gates into the first design. These proposed systems provide very less delay for result computation and low hardware utilization when compared to non-pipelined Vedic multipliers.

Until recently, it has been rather hard to experimentally realize magnetic modulation or coupling due to the lack of magnetism in GaN-based semiconductors. Here, we have fabricated the nonpolar a-plane InGaN/GaN MQWs capped by ferromagnetic CoFeB thin film. After magnetizing a CoFeB cap layer under a low magnetic field of 100 mT, the peak PL wavelength of nonpolar a-plane InGaN/GaN MQWs has a red shift from 460 to 475 nm, while its PL polarization degree shows an effective enhancement from 29% to 41% by increasing the CoFeB thickness. The magnetic-induced carrier redistribution has played a great role on the PL modulation of nonpolar InGaN/GaN MQW active region.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) can be utilized as a highly versatile and tunable platform for exploring multifunctional materials. In this study, an extra thermally stable indium-MOF (1) was synthesized via self-assembly of 1,1′-ethynebenzene-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic acid (H4EBTC) with an indium salt under solvothermal conditions. MOF 1 crystallizes in a tetragonal space group P4/mmm and shows a three-dimensional (3D) anionic framework with one-dimensional (1D) channels along the c-axis direction, and charge-balancing [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations together with lattice DMF and water molecules are accommodated in channels. This multifunctional MOF emits pure blue luminescence under ambient conditions, arising from the π∗ → π electron transition in EBTC4-, with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.07), and shows the highest quantum yield of 61.4% among indium-MOFs. Alternatively, 1 features fast proton conductivity with σ = 3.49 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 25 °C and 99% RH, attributed to the efficiently synergistic proton transfer in the H-bond networks constructed by [NH2(CH3)2]+ cations, lattice water molecules in channels and carboxylate groups in the framework.

(2019),2019,Data clustering based on Langevin annealing with a self-consistent potential,Quarterly of Applied Mathematics,"This paper introduces a novel data clustering algorithm based on Langevin dynamics, where the associated potential is constructed directly from the data. To introduce a self-consistent potential, we adopt the potential model from the established Quantum Clustering method. The first step is to use a radial basis function to construct a density distribution from the data. A potential function is then constructed such that this density distribution is the ground state solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The second step is to use this potential function with the Langevin dynamics at subcritical temperature to avoid ergodicity. The Langevin equations take a classical Gibbs distribution as the invariant measure, where the peaks of the distribution coincide with minima of the potential surface. The time dynamics of individual data points lead to different metastable states, which are interpreted as cluster centers. Clustering is therefore achieved when subsets of the data aggregate-as a result of the Langevin dynamics for a moderate period of time-in the neighborhood of a particular potential minimum. While the data points are pushed towards potential minima by the potential gradient, Brownian motion allows them to effectively tunnel through local potential barriers and escape saddle points into locations of the potential surface otherwise forbidden. The algorithm's feasibility is first established based on several illustrating examples and theoretical analyses, followed by a stricter evaluation using a standard benchmark dataset. © 2019 Brown University.",,10.1090/qam/1521,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070602969&doi=10.1090%2fqam%2f1521&partnerID=40&md5=107c571113bdab4a204f56ed9f38065c,Article

However, with the computing power improving, the existing encryption and authentication schemes are being faced with big challenges. We take the message authentication as an example into a careful consideration. Then, we proposed a new message authentication scheme with the Advanced Encryption Standard as the encryption function and the new quantum Hash function as the authentication function. Firstly, the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm is used to encrypt the result of the initial message cascading the corresponding Hash values, which ensures that the initial message can resist eavesdropping attack. Secondly, utilizing the new quantum Hash function with quantum walks can be much more secure than traditional classical Hash functions with keeping the common properties, such as one-wayness, resisting different collisions and easy implementation. Based on these two points, the message authentication scheme can be much more secure than previous ones. Finally, it is a new way to design the message authentication scheme, which provides a new thought for other researchers in the future.

In the unit cell of the metasurface, four mirror-symmetrically arranged aluminum split ring resonators (SRRs) form the bright-dark-dark-bright mode coupling and exhibit a strong electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) resonance characteristic. With monolayer graphene placed under the dark SRRs, both the transmission amplitude of EIT resonance and the group delay within the transparency window can be continuously tuned via shifting the Fermi level of graphene. Further theoretical analyses reveal that the active modulation arises from the increasing damping rate of the dark SRRs due to the recombination effect of the conductive graphene.

It shows that Alice teleports a single-qubit state to Bob and prepares a single-qubit state for Charlie, Bob teleports a single-qubit state to Charlie and prepares a single-qubit state for Alice, while Charlie teleports a single-qubit state to Alice and prepares a single-qubit state for Bob. The quantum channel is constructed by using Hadamard ( ${H}$ ) and Controlled-NOT (CNOT) operations. Participants reconstruct the desired states by performing Bell-state measurements, single-qubit measurements, and unitary transformations. Compared with existing schemes, this new scheme improves the efficiency and capacity of quantum communication because it constructs a cyclic and bidirectional quantum communication and simultaneously supports two communication protocols, quantum teleportation and remote state preparation. Only single-qubit measurements, two-qubit measurements, and basic unitary transformations are utilized in the scheme, so our operation complexity is lower than others. Thus, the scheme is likely to be implemented through physical experiments in the future. Besides this, we discuss the impact of noisy environments (amplitude-damping, phase-damping noise, bit-flip noise, and phase-flip noise) in the scheme and calculate the fidelities of the output states. It is demonstrated that the fidelities only depend on the coefficients of the initial state and the decoherence rate. © 2013 IEEE.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923322,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069036571&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2923322&partnerID=40&md5=09474041f2641eaeb7058789bce8b4d6,Article

Multiple paths between sources and detectors require an understanding of the underpinning wave-particle duality issue in the interference effects. Recently a new axiom (particle and its wave function φ(r, t) cannot be coincident or co-located at space-time point (rk, tk) unless φ(r, t) = δ(r-rk, t-tk) the Dirac delta function) has been suggested2 and justified, which explains duality without Niels Bohr's complementarity principle, thus eliminating the role of the observer, avoiding complicated ""which way"" (welcher-weg) considerations and observer subjectivity. This greatly simplifies analysis and design of multi-path quantum systems and restores objectivity. The same paper also suggested in the context of entanglement new concepts of (a) ""total causality"" that includes entanglement as a cause to locally and causally explain ""action at a distance"", and (b) ""partial causality"" that excludes entanglement as a cause and thereby introduces the perception of strange phenomena of non-locality, retro-causality and quantum erasure, which are nevertheless very important. This paper reviews and then applies the axiom to bring much needed clarity to certain confusing and much debated aspects of developments in non-interaction measurements, counterfactual communications and quantum computers.

A novel visualization of key members of the polynomial sets attributes a central role to the Kravchuk polynomials: its relationship with Wigner’s rotation matrix elements are here emphasized and taken as exemplary for computational and analytical features. The sets are considered regarding progress on the formulation of a discretization technique, the hyperquantization, which allows to efficiently deal with physical problems where quantum mechanical operators act on continuous manifolds, to yield discrete grids suitable for computation of matrix elements without need of multidimensional integration. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-030-24311-1_34,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068007196&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-24311-1_34&partnerID=40&md5=95ac8ea1b361701f32c8857459a2a7c3,Conference Paper

(2019),2019,Towards highly-efficient single-photon storage based on electromagnetically induced transparency,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Optical quantum memories are important components in the long-distance quantum communication based on quantum repeater protocol. To outperform the direct transmission of light with quantum repeaters, it is crucial to develop quantum memories with high fidelity, high efficiency and long storage time. Recently, we demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve a high storage efficiency of 92% for electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT)-based memory with weak coherent signal pulses in cold atomic ensembles [1]. To realize the highly-efficient memory with quantum light, we have built a bright and narrowband photon-pair source which can be locked to atomic transition based on the cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down conversion [2]. Here, we present our results on the storage of single photons generated by such a source in EIT-based memories. A storage efficiency of 36% is obtained in initial runs. Future improvements toward a high efficiency are discussed. Such a development paves the way for the applications of photon-pair-based quantum repeater and multi-photon synchronization. © 2019 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2513184,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067951494&doi=10.1117%2f12.2513184&partnerID=40&md5=692fcd16065aa0775722fb292ff3ee92,Conference Paper

In addition, it presents a prototypical reaction between two non-atom radical species. However, the temperature dependence of its rate coefficients has been debated for several decades. In this work, the rate coefficients are revisited by the quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) approach. To this end, a globally accurate full-dimensional potential energy surface of the ground triplet state for the title reaction is constructed using the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) method based on 108 000 points calculated at the level of CCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ, in which particular attention is paid to the initial guess in the preceding Hartree-Fock procedure to obtain reliable ab initio energies. The QCT rate coefficients are compared to available experimental and theoretical results.

Technically speaking HydRon is aiming for Tbps All-Optical Network"" solutions, dividing the satellite payload into a network part and an application part - similar to optical fiber networks on ground. The application is hooked to the network. HydRON will prepare Optical Feeder uplinks into a network of in orbit Technology Demonstrators (called HydRON#1, #2, etc.), which will be interconnected by means of Tbps laser intersatellite links. WDM Laser terminals (ground/space) and optical routing capabilities on-board the network nodes in space will be implemented together with optical payloads to enable a high throughput network connection to the applications. The space network concept will reduce the dependency on single ground stations as all HydRON nodes will get their particular data via the network they are interfacing with. A combination of new optical technologies, novel photonics equipment and efficient network concepts will be proven in orbit.

It is very much essential to bring down the energy utilization of every device deployed in IoT network without compromising the quality of service (QoS). Here, the difficulty of providing the operation between the QoS allocation and the energy competence for the industrial IoT application is deliberate. To achieve this objective, the multi-objective optimization problem to accomplish the aim of estimating the outage performance and the network lifetime is devised.

1218,Scopus,Dinur & Nadler (2019),2019,Multi-target attacks on the picnic signature scheme and related protocols,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Picnic is a signature scheme that was presented at ACM CCS 2017 by Chase et al. and submitted to NIST’s post-quantum standardization project. Among all submissions to NIST’s project, Picnic is one of the most innovative, making use of recent progress in construction of practically efficient zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols for general circuits. In this paper, we devise multi-target attacks on Picnic and its underlying ZK protocol, ZKB++. Given access to S signatures, produced by a single or by several users, our attack can (information theoretically) recover the κ-bit signing key of a user in complexity of about 2κ-7/S. This is faster than Picnic’s claimed 2κ security against classical (non-quantum) attacks by a factor of 27 S (as each signature contains about 27 attack targets). Whereas in most multi-target attacks, the attacker can easily sort and match the available targets, this is not the case in our attack on Picnic, as different bits of information are available for each target. Consequently, it is challenging to reach the information theoretic complexity in a computational model, and we had to perform cryptanalytic optimizations by carefully analyzing ZKB++ and its underlying circuit. Our best attack for κ=128 has time complexity of T=277 for S=264. Alternatively, we can reach the information theoretic complexity of T=277 for S=257, given that all signatures are produced with the same signing key. Our attack exploits a weakness in the way that the Picnic signing algorithm uses a pseudo-random generator. The weakness is fixed in the recent Picnic 2.0 version. In addition to our attack on Picnic, we show that a recently proposed improvement of the ZKB++ protocol (due to Katz, Kolesnikov and Wang) is vulnerable to a similar multi-target attack. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2019.",,10.1007/978-3-030-17659-4_24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065904547&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-17659-4_24&partnerID=40&md5=7bfc60dbdd3f82e0ec695e1ff756349d,Conference Paper

However, fully intelligent network orchestration and management for providing innovative services will only be realized in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few. Our vision for 6G is a massively connected complex network capable of rapidly responding to the users' service calls through real-time learning of the network state as described by the network edge (e.g., base-station locations and cache contents), air interface (e.g., radio spectrum and propagation channel), and the user-side (e.g., battery-life and locations). The multi-state, multi-dimensional nature of the network state, requiring the real-time knowledge, can be viewed as a quantum uncertainty problem.

In this paper, we study the extension of the feasibility of digital communication via this quantum-based antenna over a continuously tunable RF-carrier at off-resonance. Our experiment shows that the digital communication at a rate of 500 kbps can be performed reliably within a tunable bandwidth of 200 MHz near a 10.22 GHz carrier. Outside of this range, the bit error rate (BER) increases, rising to, for example, 15% at an RF-detuning of ±150 MHz. In the measurement, the time-varying RF field is retrieved by detecting the optical power of the probe laser at the center frequency of RF-induced symmetric or asymmetric Autler-Townes splitting in EIT. Prior to the digital test, we studied the RF-reception quality as a function of various parameters including the RF detuning and found that a choice of linear gain response to the RF-amplitude can suppress the signal distortion. The modulating signal can be decoded at speeds up to 500 kHz in the tunable bandwidth.

The experimental results show the feasibility, scalability, and effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA), and Dragonfly Algorithm (DFA). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-030-05481-6_4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062906524&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-05481-6_4&partnerID=40&md5=1b61510cc35bc8edf7bf15b54e68cb39,Book Chapter

Quantum signals are transmitted in an outer core separately and intercore crosstalk (IC-XT) is the main impairment of them. In order to alleviate IC-XT, we propose a quantum-classical interleave scheme. Then the properties of IC-XT are analyzed based on the measurement results, which indicate counter-propagation is a better co-existence method than co-propagation. Finally, we perform QKD experiments in the presence of two classical channels with a channel spacing of 100 GHz between quantum channel and the nearest classical channels. The experiment results prove counter-propagation almost immune to IC-XT, which is consistent with our analysis. Also, the feasibility of the transmission over the range of metropolitan area networks is validated with our scheme. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,10.1364/OE.27.005125,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062804695&doi=10.1364%2fOE.27.005125&partnerID=40&md5=7182cc74b08af5b7bc7bda3098c39a35,Article

To share such keys across the globe, space-based links are required and in the near term these will take the form of trusted node, key management satellites. We consider such channels between two nanosatellite spacecraft for polarization entanglement-based QKD, and the optical channel is described in detail. Quantum channels between satellites are useful for balancing keys within constellations of trusted node QKD satellites and, in the future, may have applications in long-distance qubit exchange between quantum computers and in fundamental physics experiments. The nanosatellite mission proposed uses an optical link with 80-mm diameter optical terminals. If such a link could be maintained with 10-μrad pointing accuracy, then this would allow QKD to be performed for satellite separations up to around 400 km.

Quantum cryptography, or quantum key distribution (QKD), relying on the physical laws of quantum mechanics, stands out as a more powerful cryptographic solution that enables the secret key to be shared securely over publicly unsecured communication channels in the presence of eavesdroppers. QKD can be possibly implemented over both optical fiber and free-space optical (FSO) links. Compared to optical fiber, FSO has the immediate advantage of flexibility and cost-effectiveness in terms of infrastructure deployment. More interestingly, recent advancements in satellite communications using FSO links promise the future of a global QKD network for highly secure applications. This paper reviews the development of QKD over FSO for both terrestrial and satellite channels, which highlights the most up-to-date QKD protocols. Owing to how the information is encoded, different QKD protocols are classified into technology-focused categories, where their properties are reviewed and compared. The feasibility of current QKD protocols is then investigated with respect to its specific application scenarios for terrestrial and satellite FSO links, equipped with results from both theoretical and experimental studies. Based on the latest free-space QKD achievements, novel perspectives for future developments and challenges to enhance the secrecy performance and reduce implementation cost are then summarized and comprehensively discussed.

(2018),2018,Benchmarking treewidth as a practical component of tensor network simulations,PLoS ONE,"Tensor networks are powerful factorization techniques which reduce resource requirements for numerically simulating principal quantum many-body systems and algorithms. The computational complexity of a tensor network simulation depends on the tensor ranks and the order in which they are contracted. Unfortunately, computing optimal contraction sequences (orderings) in general is known to be a computationally difficult (NP-complete) task. In 2005, Markov and Shi showed that optimal contraction sequences correspond to optimal (minimum width) tree decompositions of a tensor network’s line graph, relating the contraction sequence problem to a rich literature in structural graph theory. While treewidth-based methods have largely been ignored in favor of dataset-specific algorithms in the prior tensor networks literature, we demonstrate their practical relevance for problems arising from two distinct methods used in quantum simulation: multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) datasets and quantum circuits generated by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We exhibit multiple regimes where treewidth-based algorithms outperform domain-specific algorithms, while demonstrating that the optimal choice of algorithm has a complex dependence on the network density, expected contraction complexity, and user run time requirements. We further provide an open source software framework designed with an emphasis on accessibility and extendability, enabling replicable experimental evaluations and future exploration of competing methods by practitioners. © 2018 Public Library of Science.

This effect is important for satellite communication and astrophysical measurements. Previously, this redshift phenomenon was interpreted exclusively as a relativistic effect. Here we found this effect can also be explained based on a quantum mechanical consideration. We propose that, due to the quantum nature of the photon, its effective mass is not zero. In a gravitational field, the total energy of the photon includes both its quantum energy and its gravitational energy. Then, the condition of energy conservation will require a frequency shift when the photon travels between two points with different gravitational potentials. This result suggests that the gravitational redshift effect of a photon is essentially a quantum phenomenon.

We demonstrate how to leverage the latest advancements in nano-satellite body-pointing to show that our 4 kg CubeSat can generate a quantum-secure key, which has so far only been shown by a much larger 600 kg satellite mission. A comprehensive link budget and simulation was performed to calculate the secure key rates. We discuss design choices and trade-offs to maximize the key rate while minimizing the cost and development needed.

A critical figure of merit is the overall storage and retrieval efficiency. So far, despite the recent achievements of efficient memories for light pulses, the storage of qubits has suffered from limited efficiency. Here we report on a quantum memory for polarization qubits that combines an average conditional fidelity above 99% and efficiency around 68%, thereby demonstrating a reversible qubit mapping where more information is retrieved than lost. The qubits are encoded with weak coherent states at the single-photon level and the memory is based on electromagnetically-induced transparency in an elongated laser-cooled ensemble of cesium atoms, spatially multiplexed for dual-rail storage. This implementation preserves high optical depth on both rails, without compromise between multiplexing and storage efficiency.

The triggered stabilization of the CDNs allows the dictated guided reversible reconfiguration and re-equilibration of the CDNs to other CDN configurations, where some of the constituents are up-regulated, while other constituents are down-regulated. Although substantial progress in controlling the adaptive dynamic control of the compositions of networks by means of auxiliary triggers was demonstrated, the use of CDNs as active ensembles for controlling chemical functionalities is still a challenge. We report on the assembly of signal-triggered CDN systems that guide the switchable aggregation of Au nanoparticles (NPs), thereby controlling their plasmonic properties and their catalytic functions (Au NPs-catalyzed oxidation of l-DOPA to dopachrome). In addition, we demonstrate that the triggered and orthogonal up-regulation and down-regulation of the constituents of the CDNs leads to the dictated aggregation of different-sized CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), cross-linked by K+-ion-stabilized G-quadruplex units. The incorporation of hemin into the G-quadruplex cross-linking units yields horseradish peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme units that catalyze the generation of chemiluminescence via the oxidation of luminol by H2O2. The resulting chemiluminescence stimulates the chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) process to the QDs, resulting in the luminescence of the two-sized QDs. By the application of appropriate triggers, the CDN-dictated up-regulation and down-regulation of the different-sized QDs aggregates are demonstrated, and the control over the photophysical functions of the different-sized QDs, by means of the CDNs, is highlighted. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acsnano.8b05452,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054413519&doi=10.1021%2facsnano.8b05452&partnerID=40&md5=124bfcb48ce7af9cfb48ff85748bf50f,Article

On the basis of the real number delay multilinear multiplier model, an improved quantum behaved optimization (QBO) algorithm is adopted in this method to carry out indirect learning structure off-line training of the multilinear multiplier, so as to determine the model parameters as an initial value of the predistorter. And then, the least square method (LSM) algorithm is used to carry out direct learning structure on-line micro adjustment of the parameters of the predistorter and to conduct fitting on the nonlinearity and memory effect of the power amplifier. The method has the advantages of simple structure, fast convergence, and high precision, which has avoided the local optimum. The experimental results show that the adjacent channel power in this scheme is improved by approximately 7 dB compared with that of the classical dual loop structure predistortion method, and the linearization performance of the amplifier has been significantly improved, thus its feasibility has been verified. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,10.1002/cpe.4645,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054727435&doi=10.1002%2fcpe.4645&partnerID=40&md5=7851217b0876b0c5279728c30362e5af,Conference Paper

Using Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variation with the multiple Davydov D2 Ansatz, we obtain first stages of dynamical states of both the spin-boson model and the dissipative Landau-Zener model.

It is shown that the training quality of the networks is sufficient to ensure a least mean square error of 1×10-11. Subsequently, the network is cross validated by testing with additional data. Successes of the network training demonstrate that initial data of simulated open-system dynamics contain sufficient knowledge regarding its future propagation.

Much of this interest follows from the computational complexity arguments which show that the particular quantum system in which BosonSampling resides is difficult to simulate with a classical computer (assuming highly plausible conjectures) Arkhipov and Aaronson (2011 Proc. ACM STOC (New York), p 333). These arguments, however, require some understanding of both quantum optics and complexity theory - topics that are rarely seen together. This tutorial is intended to introduce a reader to the topic who has at least a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics or quantum information theory, but may be unfamiliar with either quantum optics or complexity theory. Included is some historic context as well as an outlook on the potential for BosonSampling to be the first experimental demonstration of quantum supremacy. The emphasis of the first section is to develop a general context for the subfields of quantum optics and computer science that intersect to form the BosonSampling problem. This begins with a historical introduction and a background of quantum optics. We then progress to the physical system - quantum optical networks - where BosonSampling is defined. Finally, we provide a short introduction to computational complexity theory to provide a structure where the essence behind the BosonSampling result can be discerned. The second section focuses on the BosonSampling result itself, seeking to understand the computational complexity aspects of passive linear optical networks, and what consequences this may have. Some effort is spent discussing a number of issues inherent in the BosonSampling problem that are roadblocks to limiting the scope of its applicability, but that have made progress recently and remain active topics of research. The third short section touches on the relationship between BosonSampling and other quantum computing protocols. Namely, other settings and architectures that inherit the same complexity as BosonSampling will be presented, as well as giving a summary of experimental efforts to implement BosonSampling. We discuss similarities between BosonSampling and other quantum algorithms. In the final section, some comments are presented considering future research related to the problems and protocols found in this tutorial. We suggest other unexplored directions of study which may have some bearing on the complexity of quantum optics.

In scientific computing, a significant amount of power is spent in the communication and synchronization-related idle times among distributed processes participating to the same application. However, due to the time scale at which communication happens, taking advantage of low-power states to reduce power in idle times in the computing resources, may introduce significant overheads. In this paper we present COUNTDOWN, a methodology and a tool for identifying and automatically reducing the frequency of the computing elements in order to save energy during communication and synchronization primitives. COUNTDOWN is able to filter out phases which would detriment the time to solution of the application transparently to the user, without touching the application code nor requiring recompilation of the application.

In this paper, a novel quantum neural network called quantum weighted gated recurrent unit neural network (QWGRUNN) is proposed. Firstly, quantum bits are introduced into gated recurrent unit (GRU) to express network weights and activity values. Then, a new learning algorithm based on quantum phase-shift gate and quantum gradient descent is presented to quickly update the quantum parameters of weight-qubits and activity-qubits, thus endowing QWGRUNN with faster convergence speed, superior nonlinear approximation capability and higher computational efficiency than GRUNN. Performance degradation trend prediction for rolling bearings demonstrates that higher prediction accuracy and shorter computation time can be obtained due to the advantages of QWGRUNN in terms of convergence speed, nonlinear approximation capability and computational efficiency.

Attempts to keep Biology autonomous because it is holistic, from the physical sciences, are just disguised anthropocentrism. Physical sciences have holistic features also. The autonomy of Biology is at odds with a holistic, integrated science and is preventing progress in science. For example, every cell needs a ‘global’ communication system to keep order and stability with rapid information transfer across cellular scales. We have yet to figure out how this is achieved. Over the last 30 years, we have understood that quantum mechanics is about information, mostly. However, we do not have a clear understanding of the physical significance of quantum mechanics in nature. Also, the view that quantum mechanics is restricted to the atomic and molecular scale is mistaken and a direct result of the mass of the electron being so big. In 1988 the mass of the electron neutrino was predicted to lie between 0.5 and 0.05 eV/c 2 and to have a key role in Biology. This would allow quantum mechanical processes on a cellular and intercellular scale and provide a possible basis for a ‘global’ information system in the cell and an understanding of the information role of quantum mechanics in nature. Recent non-results, on the electron neutrino mass, from the KATRIN experiment are pushing the upper limit of the electron neutrino mass to less than 0.5 eV/c 2 making the prediction of 30 years ago more likely. © 2018, Anka Publishers.

Experience with classical hardware and software systems has shown the difficulty of achieving robust and reliable implementations. We present CCSq, a concurrent language for describing quantum systems, and develop verification techniques for checking equivalence between CCSq processes. CCSq has well-defined operational and superoperator semantics for protocols that are functional, in the sense of computing a deterministic input-output relation for all interleavings arising from concurrency in the system. We have implemented QEC (Quantum Equivalence Checker), a tool that takes the specification and implementation of quantum protocols, described in CCSq, and automatically checks their equivalence. QEC is the first fully automatic equivalence checking tool for concurrent quantum systems.

The realization of experiments that can perform both capabilities in the same setup can open an avenue of possibilities in the development of such practical quantum technologies. We theoretically investigate the feasibility of implementing a quantum memory and an optical transistor in the same setup using a combination of electromagnetically induced transparency and cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-EIT) for single- and two-sided cavity configurations. This was accomplished by considering a single three-level atom in Λ configuration coupled to a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity and a suitable temporal shape for the EIT control field. An optical transistor in cavity-EIT can be realized in a symmetric cavity with two output channels while a high efficient quantum memory must be performed in a single-sided one. From the master equation and input–output formalisms for the intracavity and outside fields, respectively, we obtain the upper bound of 50 % for the memory efficiency with perfect transistor action in two-sided cavities and values close to 100 % for the efficiency with a limited transistor effect for the single-sided setup in the high cooperativity regime. Thus, we showed that a dual device, which operates as a quantum memory and an optical transistor in the same setup of cavity-EIT, can be accomplished with some limitation in one of those capabilities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11128-018-2069-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054318673&doi=10.1007%2fs11128-018-2069-5&partnerID=40&md5=6d8e6307b0781f1f8fc1bf32916d5a11,Article
1263,Scopus,Dueñas-Osorio et al. (2018),2018,Quantum-inspired Boolean states for bounding engineering network reliability assessment,Structural Safety,"Significant methodological progress has taken place to quantify the reliability of networked systems over the past decades. Both numerical and analytical methods have enjoyed improvements via a host of advanced Monte Carlo simulation strategies, state space partition methods, statistical learning, and Boolean functions among others. The latter approach exploits logic to approximate network reliability assessments efficiently while offering theoretical error guarantees. In parallel, physicists have made progress modeling complex systems via tensor networks (TNs), particularly quantum many-body systems. Inspired by the representation power of quantum TNs, this paper offers a new approach to efficiently bound all-terminal network reliability (ATR). It does so by exactly solving a related network Boolean satisfiability counting problem (or #SATNET), represented as a TN, by counting configurations in which all network nodes are connected to at least a neighbor. Our #SATNET counting outperforms state-of-the-art approximate and exact counters for the same problem as shown for challenging two-dimensional lattice networks of increasing size. While the over-counting from #SATNET increases exponentially relative to the number of configurations that satisfy ATR problems (or #RELAT), the bias is predictable for ideal networks, such as lattices, and our upper-bound is guaranteed with 100% confidence. This bound also cuts through the upper bound from other analytical methods for the ATR problem, such as recursive decomposition algorithms (RDA)—a desirable feature when exact or approximate methods with error guarantees fail to scale. Clearly, our goal is not to solve the general stochastic network reliability problem, which remains a #P problem in the computational complexity hierarchy (i.e., a counting version of non-deterministic polynomial time [NP] problems for which there is no known polynomial time algorithms to find their solutions).

Thanks to various material and optical characteristics of crystalline silicon, the silicon-on-insulator platform has become the dominant material platform for silicon photonics. Meanwhile, monolithic or heterogeneous integration of other materials on silicon photonic chips, including the silicon nitride (SiN)-on-insulator platform and the III-V-on-silicon platform, are under rapid developments to enhance the functionalities of silicon photonics. Among the myriad of silicon photonic structures for passive and active components, integrated microresonators are promising for a broad range of applications due to their strong resonance field enhancement, narrowband wavelength selectivity, and compact footprints. In this paper, we review the state of the art and our perspectives on emerging technologies based on integrated silicon photonic microresonators in the technology domains of intradatacenter optical interconnects, integrated nonlinear and quantum photonics, and lab-on-a-chip optical biosensing.

(2018),2018,Nonlinear optical responses of carbon quantum dots anchored on graphene oxide hybrid in solid-state transparent monolithic silica gel glasses,Optics and Laser Technology,"Exploring the nonlinear optical (NLO) response of graphene-based hybrids in solid-state three-dimensional macrostructures is vital to promote the practical development of graphene-based photonic and optoelectronic devices. Here, a solid-state hybrid of ultrafine and well-dispersed carbon quantum dots (CQDs) supported on graphene oxide (GO) was chosen as representative of such materials. The hybrid was introduced into organically modified silica gel glasses using a facile sol-gel wet chemical technique to obtain stable transparent monolithic nanocomposites, and their practical application in nonlinear optics was explored. The NLO performances were investigated by the open-aperture (OA) and closed-aperture (CA) Z-scan techniques in the nanosecond regime using a laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. The as-prepared CQD/GO SiO2 gel glasses displayed completely different NLO behavior from that of a CQD/GO suspension. The NLO performance of CQD/GO significantly improved after incorporation into SiO2 gel glasses because of the more graphitized structure of the CQD/GO hybrid. Both the OA and CA Z-scan patterns suggested that the NLO properties of the CQD/GO suspension combined nonlinear absorption and nonlinear scattering, while the NLO response of the CQD/GO SiO2 gel glasses stemmed primarily from nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction. In addition, this is the first report of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility χ(3) of a CQD/GO hybrid doped in solid-state gel glasses. The present results therefore demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of CQD/GO silica gel glasses, a promising new class of highly efficient NLO materials that can be applied in optical communications, radiofrequency optoelectronics, and all-optical signal processing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.optlastec.2018.06.013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048258262&doi=10.1016%2fj.optlastec.2018.06.013&partnerID=40&md5=c6c8a898631e2960bdecb2cb7281243f,Article

Nevertheless, Pb-metal toxicity remains a huge hurdle for extensive applications of these compounds. Thus, alternative compounds with similar optoelectronic properties need to be developed. Bismuth possesses electronic structure similar to that of lead with the presence of ns 2 electrons that exhibit rich structural variety as well as interesting optical and electronic properties. Herein, we critically assess Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 as a candidate for thin-film solar cell absorber. Despite a reasonable optical band gap (∼2 eV) and absorption coefficient, the power conversion efficiency of the Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 mesoscopic solar cells was found to be severely lacking, limited by the poor photocurrent density. The efficiency of the Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 solar cell can be slightly improved by changing the stoichiometry of the precursor solutions, which is most probably due to the reduction in nonradiative defects as evident from our single-crystal photoluminescence spectroscopy. However, detailed investigations on pristine Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 reveal that zero-dimensional molecular crystal structure remains one of the main bottlenecks in achieving high performance. On the basis of our comprehensive studies, we have proposed that a continuous network of three-dimensional crystal structure should be another major criterion in addition to proper band gap and suitable optical properties of the future PV compounds. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acsami.7b14735,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054133109&doi=10.1021%2facsami.7b14735&partnerID=40&md5=5d105751706b6021731d9d7917ca6e4c,Article
1267,Scopus,Li et al. (2018),2018,Multi-human parsing machines,MM 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Multimedia Conference,"Human parsing is an important task in human-centric analysis. Despite the remarkable progress in single-human parsing, the more realistic case of multi-human parsing remains challenging in terms of the data and the model. Compared with the considerable number of available single-human parsing datasets, the datasets for multi-human parsing are very limited in number mainly due to the huge annotation effort required. Besides the data challenge to multi-human parsing, the persons in real-world scenarios are often entangled with each other due to close interaction and body occlusion, making it difficult to distinguish body parts from different person instances. In this paper we propose the Multi-Human Parsing Machines (MHPM) system, which contains an MHP Montage model and an MHP Solver, to address both challenges in multi-human parsing. Specifically, the MHP Montage model in MHPM generates realistic images with multiple persons together with the parsing labels. It intelligently composes single persons onto background scene images while maintaining the structural information between persons and the scene. The generated images can be used to train better multi-human parsing algorithms. On the other hand, the MHP Solver in MHPM solves the bottleneck of distinguishing multiple entangled persons with close interaction. It employs a Group-Individual Push and Pull (GIPP) loss function, which can effectively separate persons with close interaction. We experimentally show that the proposed MHPM can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the multi-human parsing benchmark and the person individualization benchmark, which distinguishes closely entangled person instances. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Highly stable free radicals achieved through the self-polymerization of TCNQ, these radicals originate from the 90° rotation of cyclohexadiene rings into phenyl rings and 120° ferromagnetic order around the triazine rings. The presence of unpaired electrons (radicals) in p-TCNQ was established by solid-state electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and the long-range magnetic ordering through the network was characterized by a Quantum Design SQUID-VSM. Designing and manipulating the spins in polymer networks via organic methodologies will provide alternative approaches for versatile future applications of plastic magnets. For over two decades, there has been widespread skepticism around claims of organic plastic ferromagnetism, mostly as a result of contamination by transition metals. Excluding the contamination issues and realizing magnetic properties from pure organic plastics must occur to revive the quest for plastic magnetism. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and magnetic properties of a triazine network polymer demonstrating room-temperature ferromagnetism derived from pure organic single crystals. The polymer network was realized through the self-polymerization of tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). We generated highly stable free radicals by twisting π bonds around the triazine rings and by trapping them in the glassy state of a polymerized TCNQ (p-TCNQ) network structure. Magnetic characterization revealed the presence of spin-½ moments, which led to ferromagnetic ordering with a critical temperature significantly higher than room temperature. Polymerized TCNQ was evaluated as a metal-free ferromagnetically active organic material and showed unusual ferromagnetic properties.

Prominent examples are Kerr frequency comb generation in microresonators, and supercontinuum generation and frequency conversion in nonlinear photonic waveguides. A high conversion efficiency is enabling for applications of nonlinear optics, including such broad directions as high-speed optical signal processing, metrology, and quantum communication and computation. In this work, a gallium-arsenide-on-insulator (GaAs) platform for nonlinear photonics is demonstrated. GaAs has among the highest second- and third-order nonlinear optical coefficients, and the use of a silica cladding results in waveguides with a large refractive index contrast and low propagation loss for expanded designs of nonlinear processes. By harnessing these properties and developing nanofabrication with GaAs, a record normalized second-harmonic efficiency of 13 000% W−1cm−2 at a fundamental wavelength of 2 µm is reported.

In this paper, a novel quantum neural network called quantum weighted long short-term memory neural network (QWLSTMNN) is proposed. First, quantum bits are introduced into the long short-term memory unit to express network weights and activity values. Then, a new learning algorithm based on quantum phase-shift gate and quantum gradient descent is presented to quickly update the quantum parameters of weight qubits and activity qubits. The above characteristics endow QWLSTMNN with better nonlinear approximation capability, higher generalization property and faster convergence speed than LSTMNN. State degradation trend prediction for rolling bearings demonstrates that higher prediction accuracy and higher computational efficiency can be obtained due to the advantages of QWLSTMNN in terms of nonlinear approximation capability, generalization property and convergence speed. It is believed that the proposed method based on QWLSTMNN is effective for state degradation trend prediction of rotating machinery. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.neunet.2018.07.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050891274&doi=10.1016%2fj.neunet.2018.07.004&partnerID=40&md5=950ad1ba6924df1aa993c7e20b1a90ae,Article

1274,Scopus,Schlawin et al. (2018),2018,Entangled Two-Photon Absorption Spectroscopy,Accounts of Chemical Research,"ConspectusThe application of quantum states of light such as entangled photons, for example, created by parametric down conversion, has experienced tremendous progress in the almost 40 years since their first experimental realization. Initially, they were employed in the investigation of the foundations of quantum physics, such as the violation of Bell's inequalities and studies of quantum entanglement. They later emerged as basic platforms for quantum communication protocols and, in the recent experiments on single-photon interactions, in photonic quantum computation. These applications aim at the controlled manipulation of the photonic degrees of freedom, and therefore rely on simple models of matter, where the analysis is simpler. Furthermore, quantum imaging with entangled light can achieve enhanced resolution, and quantum metrology can overcome the shot noise limit for classical light.This Account focuses on an entirely different emerging class of applications using quantum light as a powerful spectroscopic tool to reveal novel information about complex molecules. These applications utilize two appealing properties of quantum light: its distinct intensity fluctuations and its nonclassical bandwidth properties. These give rise to new and surprising behavior of nonlinear optical signals. Nonclassical intensity fluctuations can enhance nonlinear optical signals relative to linear absorption. For instance, the two-photon absorption of entangled photon pairs scales linearly (rather than quadratically) in the photon flux, just like a single photon absorption. This enables nonlinear quantum spectroscopy of photosensitive, for example, biological, samples at low light intensities. We will discuss how the two-photon absorption cross section becomes a function of the photonic quantum state, which can be manipulated by properties of the entangled photon pairs. In addition, the quantum correlations in entangled photon states further influence the nonlinear signals in a variety of ways. Apart from affecting the signal's scaling with intensity, they also constitute an entirely new approach to shaping and controlling excitation pathways in molecular aggregates in a way that cannot be achieved with shaped classical pulses. This is because between the two absorption events in entangled two-photon absorption, the light and material system are entangled. Classical constraints for the simultaneous time and frequency resolution can thus be circumvented, since the two are not Fourier conjugates.Here we review the simplest manifestation of quantum light spectroscopy, two-photon absorption spectroscopy with entangled photons. This will allow us to discuss exemplarily the impact of quantum properties of light on a nonlinear optical signal and explore the opportunities for future applications. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00173,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053345012&doi=10.1021%2facs.accounts.8b00173&partnerID=40&md5=96207073b95ede24dd02c6b257070c3a,Article
1275,Scopus,Zaleski & Prozument (2018),2018,Automated assignment of rotational spectra using artificial neural networks,Journal of Chemical Physics,"A typical broadband rotational spectrum may contain several thousand observable transitions, spanning many species. While these spectra often encode troves of chemical information, identifying and assigning the individual spectra can be challenging. Traditional approaches typically involve visually identifying a pattern. A more modern approach is to apply an automated fitting routine. In this approach, combinations of 3 transitions are searched by trial and error, to fit the A, B, and C rotational constants in a Watson-type Hamiltonian. In this work, we develop an alternative approach - to utilize machine learning to train a computer to recognize the patterns inherent in rotational spectra. Broadband high-resolution rotational spectra are perhaps uniquely suited for pattern recognition, assignment, and species identification using machine learning. Repeating patterns of transition frequencies and intensities are now routinely recorded in broadband chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave experiments in which both the number of resolution elements and the dynamic range surpass 104. At the same time, these high-resolution spectra are extremely sensitive to molecular geometry with each polar species having a unique rotational spectrum. Here we train the feed forward neural network on thousands of rotational spectra that we calculate, using the rules of quantum mechanics, from randomly generated sets of rotational constants and other Hamiltonian parameters. Reasonable physical constraints are applied to these parameter sets, yet they need not belong to existing species. A trained neural network presented with a spectrum identifies its type (e.g., linear molecule, symmetric top, or asymmetric top) and infers the corresponding Hamiltonian parameters (rotational constants, distortion, and hyperfine constants). The classification and prediction times, about 160 μs and 50 μs, respectively, seem independent of the spectral complexity or the number of molecular parameters.

We give the way to design the universal hyperparallel photonic quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate on a two-photon system, resorting to the nonlinear interaction between the circularly polarized photon and the electron spin in the quantum dot in a double-sided microcavity system, by taking the imperfect interaction in the nearly realistic condition into account. Its self-error-corrected pattern prevents the bit-flip errors from happening in the hyperparallel quantum CNOT gate, guarantees the robust fidelity, and relaxes the requirement for its experiment. Meanwhile, this scheme works in a failure-heralded way. Also, we generalize this approach to achieve the self-error-corrected hyperparallel quantum CNOTN gate working on a multiple-photon system. These good features make this scheme more useful in the photonic quantum computation and quantum communication in the future.",,10.1364/OE.26.023333,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057380868&doi=10.1364%2fOE.26.023333&partnerID=40&md5=3fa2cbb0925e8d304781ec0d2153ba2e,Article
1282,Scopus,Oszmaniec & Brod (2018),2018,Classical simulation of photonic linear optics with lost particles,New Journal of Physics,"We explore the possibility of efficient classical simulation of linear optics experiments under the effect of particle losses. Specifically, we investigate the canonical boson sampling scenario in which an n-particle Fock input state propagates through a linear-optical network and is subsequently measured by particle-number detectors in the m output modes. We examine two models of losses. In the first model a fixed number of particles is lost. We prove that in this scenario the output statistics can be well approximated by an efficient classical simulation, provided that the number of photons that is left grows slower than . In the second loss model, every time a photon passes through a beamsplitter in the network, it has some probability of being lost. For this model the relevant parameter is s, the smallest number of beamsplitters that any photon traverses as it propagates through the network. We prove that it is possible to approximately simulate the output statistics already if s grows logarithmically with m, regardless of the geometry of the network. The latter result is obtained by proving that it is always possible to commute s layers of uniform losses to the input of the network regardless of its geometry, which could be a result of independent interest. We believe that our findings put strong limitations on future experimental realizations of quantum computational supremacy proposals based on boson sampling. © 2018 The Author(s).

A model between deformation data and the factors data that affected deformation is built in this study. The factors contain hydro-geological factors and meteorological factors. Their relationship presents a complex nonlinear relationship which cannot be solved by ordinary methods such as multiple linear regression. With the development of artificial intelligence algorithm, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Learning Machine come to the fore. Support Vector Machine could establish a deformation prediction model perfectly in the condition that there is less input data and output data. The deformation forecast model that uses quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm is selected to optimize the Support Vector Machine. The optimum configuration of Support Vector Machine model needs to be determined by two parameters, that is, normalized mean square error and correlation coefficient (R). Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization could determine the optimal parameter values by minimizing normalized mean square error. It investigates the application effect of the proposed quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization–Support Vector Machine model by comparing their performances of popular forecasting models, such as Support Vector Machine, GA-Support Vector Machine, and particle swarm optimization–Support Vector Machine models. The results show that the proposed model has better performances in mine slope surface deformation and is superior to its rivals. © The Author(s) 2018.",,10.1177/1687814018796330,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054141474&doi=10.1177%2f1687814018796330&partnerID=40&md5=06d6eb06299563a1489ce802843ff23e,Article

A significant issue in Machine Type Communication is the presence of large numbers of communicating devices overloading the network with their signaling messages. This overload can have negative impacts in terms of delays and termination of security procedures, like authentication, affecting both HTC and MTC. In this paper, we propose a group authentication and key agreement protocol using Extended Chebyshev's Chaotic Map. The proposed protocol provides an efficient, in terms of reduced signaling traffic generated during the authentication procedure, and provably secure method for authenticating a group of MTCDs by the core network.

Because of its ultra-low power and extremely-small size features, the quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is most promising nanoelectronic technology for implementing digital systems with security capabilities. This paper presents a novel QCA implementation of TRNG, which is comprised of proposed cross-coupled circuit and cross-oriented structure, in order to generate truly random numbers. This implementation extracts the randomness from the oscillatory trajectory of QCA cross-coupled loop that is composed of XNOR gates only to guarantee the quality of randomness. Furthermore, it exploits the oscillatory metastability resulting from zero-energy QCA cells of cross-oriented structure that is connected across cross-coupled outputs to increase the quality of randomness. Its behavior is verified through QCA simulations and its architecture is passed statistical tests of random numbers. Consequently, the proposed QCA-based TRNG can be considered as a promising candidate for future security applications in Nano communications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.nancom.2018.04.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047261486&doi=10.1016%2fj.nancom.2018.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=dee7e82989c7e2323e5fc92b683245d6,Article

(2018),2018,Dynamic Adaptable Asynchronous Progress Model for MPI RMA Multiphase Applications,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"Casper is a process-based asynchronous progress model for MPI one-sided communication on multi-and many-core architectures. The one-sided communication is not truly one-sided in most MPI implementations: the target process still relies on software progress to complete incoming operations. Casper allows the user to specify an arbitrary number of cores dedicated to background ghost processes and transparently redirects the RMA operations to ghost processes by utilizing the PMPI redirection and MPI-3 shared-memory technologies. Although Casper benefits applications that suffer from lack of asynchronous progress, the operation redirection design might not support complex multiphase applications effectively, which often involve dynamically changing communication density and computing workloads. In this paper, we present an adaptive mechanism in Casper to address the limitation of static asynchronous progress in multiphase applications. We exploit two adaptive strategies, a user-guided strategy and a fully transparent and automatic strategy based on self-profiling and prediction, to dynamically reconfigure the asynchronous progress in Casper according to real-time performance characteristics during multiphase execution. We evaluate the adaptive approaches in both microbenchmarks and a real quantum chemistry application suite, NWChem, on the Cray XC30 supercomputer and an Intel Omni-Path cluster. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",,10.1109/TPDS.2018.2815568,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043775595&doi=10.1109%2fTPDS.2018.2815568&partnerID=40&md5=e2235f284b076f5d628382e543c09441,Article

(2018),2018,Metrological quantification of CO in biogas using laser absorption spectroscopy and gas chromatography,Measurement Science and Technology,"Biogas has a vital role in the future market for renewable energy. When upgraded to biomethane, it can be injected into natural gas grids if the level of certain impurities complies with the specifications in EN16723. For some of these impurities, suitable measurement methods are lacking which hamper the quality control of biomethane to be injected into natural gas networks. Here, we report on the evaluation of three detection methods suitable for carbon monoxide (CO) in biogas and biomethane applications for which EN16723 specifies an upper limit of 0.1% (1000 μmol ⋅ mol-1). Two of these methods are based on laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) and one on gas chromatography (GC). Both LAS spectrometers employ direct absorption spectroscopy and operate at 4.6 μm, probing a single CO absorption line in the fundamental CO band. One of them, direct tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (dTDLAS), is based on a new interband cascade laser specially designed for biogas and biomethane applications, while the other is based on quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS). The GC is equipped with two packed columns (HayeSep Q and molecular sieve 5A) and a thermal conductivity detector. CO amount fraction results in biogas matrices derived using these three measurement methods and are compared to amount fraction values of different, gravimetrically prepared reference gas standards of CO in biogas. These were used to validate the measurement capabilities. The measured CO amount fraction results from LAS and GC covered 10-30 000 μmol ⋅ mol-1 (system measurement ranges, LAS: 3-1000 μmol ⋅ mol-1, GC: 500-30 000 μmol ⋅ mol-1) and were in excellent agreement with the gravimetric values of the gas standards. At 400 μmol ⋅ mol-1, the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement compliant relative standard uncertainties of our calibration-free dTDLAS and the gas-calibrated QCLAS systems are estimated to be 1.4% versus 0.5%, respectively. The relative standard uncertainty of the GC CO measurements at 5075 μmol ⋅ mol-1 is 1.3%. This work demonstrates that, by means of GC and LAS, relative standard uncertainties of 1.4% and below can be reached for CO measurements in biogas and that cost-optimized calibration-free approaches not requiring frequent use of gas standards have become available. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,10.1088/1361-6501/aad116,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051718594&doi=10.1088%2f1361-6501%2faad116&partnerID=40&md5=6f70ccf93385ec4f2a7433c25369736a,Article

Here we show how these factors affect performance of CVQKD, by considering our newly derived key rate formulas for fading channels, which involves detection imperfections, thus form a transmission model for CVQKD. This model can help evaluate the feasibility of experiment scheme in practical applications. We found that performance deterioration of horizontal link within the boundary layer is primarily caused by transmittance fluctuations (including beam wandering, broadening, deformation, and scintillation), while transmittance change due to pulse broadening under weak turbulence is negligible. Besides, we also found that communication interruptions can also cause a perceptible key rate reduction when the transmission distance is longer, while phase excess noise due to arrival time fluctuations requires new compensation techniques to reduce it to a negligible level. Furthermore, it is found that performing homodyne detection enables longer transmission distances, whereas heterodyne allows higher achievable key rate over short distances. © 2018 The Author(s).

It reduces glucose to sorbitol in the presence of NADPH and the major cause of diabetes complications could be the change in the osmotic pressure due to the accumulation of sorbitol. An activated form of hAR (activated hAR or ahAR) poses a potential obstacle in the development of diabetes drugs as hAR-inhibitors are ineffective against ahAR. The therapeutic efficacy of such drugs is compromised when a large fraction of the enzyme (hAR) undergoes conversion to the activated ahAR form as has been observed in the diabetic tissues. In the present study, attempts have been made to employ systems biology strategies to identify the elementary nodes of human polyol metabolic pathway, responsible for normal metabolic states, followed by the identification of natural potent inhibitors of the activated form of hAR represented by the mutant C298S for possible antidiabetic applications.

Our methods require no knowledge of the underlying noise model afflicting the quantum device making them appealing for real-world experiments. Our analysis is based on a full circuit-level noise model. It considers both distance-three and five codes, and is performed near the codes pseudo-threshold regime. Training DND in low noise rate regimes appears to be a challenging machine learning endeavour. We provide a detailed description of our neural network architectures and training methodology.

(2018),2018,Coherence Properties of Molecular Single Photons for Quantum Networks,Physical Review X,"Quantum mechanics implies that a single photon can be in the superposition of two distant spatial modes and enable nonlocal interferences. The most vivid example is the two-photon coalescence on a 550 beam splitter, known as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. In the past decade, this experiment has been used to characterize the suitability of different single-photon sources for linear optical quantum gates. This characterization alone cannot guarantee the suitability of the photons in a scalable quantum network. As for a deeper insight, we perform a number of nonclassical interference measurements of single photons emitted by a single organic molecule that are optimized by an atomic Faraday filter. Our measurements reveal near unity visibility of the quantum interference, and a one-port correlation measurement proves the ideal Fourier limited nature of our single-photon source. A delayed choice quantum eraser allows us to observe a constructive interference between the photons, and a Hong-Ou-Mandel peak is formed additionally to the commonly observed dip. These experiments comprehensively characterize the involved photons for their use in a future quantum Internet, and they attest to the fully efficient interaction of the molecular photons with a next subsequent quantum node. They can be adapted to other emitters and will allow us to gain insights to their applicability for quantum information processing. We introduce a quality number that describes the photon's properties for their use in a quantum network; this states that effectively 97% of the utilized molecular photons can be used in a scalable quantum optical system and interact with other quantum nodes.

Military forces all over the world have come to value the new role of cyberspace in warfare, building up cyber commands, and establishing new capabilities. Integral to such capabilities is that military forces fundamentally depend on the rapid exchange of information in order for their decision-making processes to gain superiority on the battlefield; this compounds the need to develop network- enabled capabilities to realize network-centric warfare. This triangle of cyber offense, cyber defence, and cyber dependence creates a challenging and complex system of interdependencies. Alongside, while numerous technologies have not improved cyber security significantly, this may change with upcoming new concepts and systems, like decentralized ledger technologies (Blockchains) or quantum-secured communication. Following these thoughts, the paper analyses the development of both cyber threats and defence capabilities during the past 10 years, evaluates the current situation and gives recommendations for improvements. To this end, the paper is structured as follows: first, general conditions for military forces with respect to ""cyber"" are described, including an analysis of the most likely courses of action of the West and their seemingly traditional adversary in the East, Russia. The overview includes a discussion of the usefulness of the measures and an overview of upcoming technologies critical for cyber security.

Owing to the notorious difficulty and immaturity in genetic manipulation of higher fungi as well as their slow growth, biosynthesis of GAs in a heterologous host is an attractive alternative for their efficient bioproduction. In this study, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host, we did a systematic screening of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450) gene candidates from G. lucidum, which may be responsible for the GA biosynthesis from lanosterol but have not been functionally characterized. As a result, overexpression of a CYP450 gene cyp5150l8 was firstly found to produce an antitumor GA, 3-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-26 oic acid (HLDOA) in S. cerevisiae, as confirmed by HPLC, LC-MS and NMR. A final titer of 14.5 mg/L of HLDOA was obtained at 120 hr of the yeast fermentation. Furthermore, our in vitro enzymatic experiments indicate that CYP5150L8 catalyzes a three-step biotransformation of lanosterol at C-26 to synthesize HLDOA. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the heterologous biosynthesis of GAs.

Applications include computing the arithmetic complexity of matrix multiplication in algebraic complexity theory, deciding the feasibility of an asymptotic transformation between pure quantum States via stochastic local operations and classical communication in quantum information theory, bounding the query complexity of certain properties in algebraic property testing, and bounding the size of combinatorial structures like tri-colored sum-free sets in additive combinatorics. Naturally, the asymptotic restriction problem asks for obstructions (think of lower bounds in computational complexity) and constructions (think of fast matrix multiplication algorithms). Strassen showed that for obstructions it is sufficient to consider maps from k-tensors to nonnegative reals, that are monotone under restriction, normalised on diagonal tensors, additive under direct sum and multiplicative under tensor product, named spectral points (SFCS 1986 and J. Reine Angew. Math. 1988). Strassen introduced the support functionals, which are spectral points for oblique tensors, a strict subfamily of all tensors (J. Reine Angew. Math. 1991). On the construction side, an important work is the Coppersmith–Winograd method for tight tensors and tight sets. We present the first nontrivial spectral points for the family of all complex tensors, named quantum functionals. Finding such universal spectral points has been an open problem for thirty years. We use techniques from quantum information theory, invariant theory and moment polytopes. We present comparisons among the support functionals and our quantum functionals, and compute generic values. We relate the functionals to instability from geometric invariant theory, in the spirit of Blasiak et al. (Discrete Anal. 2017).

Interpreting the resulting models is often omitted or performed erroneously altogether. In this work, a comprehensive comparative study of six methods (PaD, PaD2, weights, stepwise, perturbation and profile) for exploration and interpretation of ANN models built for prediction of Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) QM descriptors, is presented. Sum of ranking differences (SRD) was used for ranking of the six methods with respect to the contributions of the calculated QM molecular descriptors toward TEAC. The results show that the PaD, PaD2 and profile methods are the most stable and give rise to realistic interpretation of the observed correlations.

In the present contribution, we employ QM/MM models to investigate the mechanism of such remarkably different spectral variations, which are caused by just a few amino acid replacements. We show that the models, which are based on CASPT2//CASSCF level of QM theory, reproduce the observed trends in absorption maxima, with only a 3.5 kcal/mol blue-shift, and in emission maxima, with an even smaller 1.5 kcal/mol blue-shift with respect to the observed quantities. In order to explain the variations across the series, we look at the chromophore's electronic structure change during absorption and emission. Such analysis indicates that a change in charge-transfer character, which is more pronounced during absorption, triggers a cascade of hydrogen-bond-network rearrangements, suggesting preparation to an isomerization event. We also show how the contribution of Arg 89 and Arg 64 residues to the chromophore conformational changes correlate with the spectral variations in absorption and emission. Furthermore, we describe how the conical intersection stability is related to the protein's photophysical properties. While for the Dronpa, rsFastLime, and rsKame triad, the stability correlates with the photoswitching speed, this does not happen for bsDronpa and Padron, suggesting a less obvious photoisomerization mechanism.

Here we experimentally demonstrate a machine-learning approach to construct a quantum-state classifier for identifying the separability of quantum states. We show that it is possible to experimentally train an artificial neural network to efficiently learn and classify quantum states, without the need of obtaining the full information of the states.

The calculated source detection efficiencies are then used to normalize the VHF source data out to a range of 125 km, as a method for correcting the detection efficiency drop-off with range. The data are also sorted into flashes using a popular flash-sorting algorithm in order to compare how well flash sorting corrects for detection efficiency drop-off with range compared to the normalization method.

1328,Scopus,Yagi & Yang (2018),2018,Probing gravitational parity violation with gravitational waves from stellar-mass black hole binaries,Physical Review D,"The recent discovery of gravitational-wave events has offered us unique test beds of gravity in the strong and dynamical field regime. One possible modification to General Relativity is the gravitational parity violation that arises naturally from quantum gravity. Such parity violation gives rise to the so-called amplitude birefringence in gravitational waves, in which one of the circularly polarized modes is amplified while the other one is suppressed during their propagation. In this paper, we study how well one can measure gravitational parity violation via the amplitude birefringence effect of gravitational waves sourced by stellar-mass black hole binaries. We choose Chern-Simons gravity as an example and work within an effective field theory formalism to ensure that the approximate theory is well posed. We consider gravitational waves from both individual sources and stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds. Regarding bounds from individual sources, we estimate such bounds using a Fisher analysis and carry out Monte Carlo simulations by randomly distributing sources over their sky location and binary orientation. We find that the bounds on the scalar field evolution in Chern-Simons gravity from the recently discovered gravitational-wave events are too weak to satisfy the weak Chern-Simons approximation, while aLIGO with its design sensitivity can place meaningful bounds. Regarding bounds from stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds, we set the threshold signal-to-noise ratio for detection of the parity-violation mode as 5 and estimate projected bounds with future detectors assuming that signals are consistent with no parity violation. In an ideal situation in which all the source parameters and binary black hole merger-rate history are known a priori, we find that a network of two third-generation detectors is able to place bounds that are comparable to or slightly stronger than binary pulsar bounds. In a more realistic situation in which one does not have such information beforehand, approximate bounds can be derived if the regular parity-insensitive mode is detected and the peak redshift of the merger-rate history is known theoretically. Since gravitational-wave observations probe either the difference in parity violation between the source and the detector (with individual sources) or the line-of-sight cosmological integration of the scalar field (with gravitational-wave backgrounds), such bounds are complementary to local measurements from solar system experiments and binary pulsar observations. © 2018 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevD.97.104018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048075824&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevD.97.104018&partnerID=40&md5=e07dc3f875e687674384fd4538f62353,Article

1340,Scopus,Vural et al. (2018),2018,Two-photon interference in an atom–quantum dot hybrid system,Optica,"Future quantum networks will need flying qubits and stationary nodes. As for the generation of single photons which may act as flying qubits, resonantly excited single-semiconductor quantum dots are ideal in terms of their on-demand single-photon emission, indistinguishability, and brightness. Atomic systems can effectively act as mediators for photon–photon interactions, storage media, or building blocks for stationary qubits. Here, we hybridize these two systems and investigate the non-classical interference of spectral Lorentzian-shaped photons, fine-tuned between the cesium (Cs)-D1 hyperfine resonances. The temporal delay in the dispersive hot atomic cesium vapor amounts up to 50 times the photons’ initial width and reveals beats on the single quanta. The photons’ indistinguishability is preserved even after atomic-enabled delay. This proves that the interaction with the Cs vapor conserves the photons’ coherence. The role of spectral diffusion in the solid-state emitter is studied in single- and two-photon experiments in light of the strong frequency dependence of the atomic medium. Our results pave the way for efficient hybrid interfaces between quantum dots and hot atomic vapors as storage media in future quantum networks. © 2018 Optical Society of America.",,10.1364/OPTICA.5.000367,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045966186&doi=10.1364%2fOPTICA.5.000367&partnerID=40&md5=e2431891c6dccc016611ee8fe53a2bad,Article

In these circuits nearly all cells receive a clock signal and a placement algorithm that ignores the clock routing cost will not produce high quality solutions. To address this issue, proposed approach simultaneously minimizes the total wirelength of the signal nets and area overhead of the clock routing. Furthermore, construction of a perfect H-tree in SFQ logic circuits is not viable solution due to the resulting very high routing overhead and the in-feasibility of building exact zero-skew clock routing trees. Instead a hybrid clock tree must be used whereby higher levels of the clock tree (i.e., those closer to the clock source) are based on H-tree construction whereas lower levels of the clock tree follow a linear (i.e., chain-like) structure.

1342,Scopus,Afzal & Asharaf (2018),2018,Deep multiple multilayer kernel learning in core vector machines,Expert Systems with Applications,"Over the last few years, we have been witnessing a dramatic progress of deep learning in many real world applications. Deep learning concepts have been originated in the area of neural network and show a quantum leap in effective feature learning techniques such as auto-encoders, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks etc. In the case of kernel machines, there are several attempts to model learning machines that mimic deep neural networks. In this direction, Multilayer Kernel Machines (MKMs) was an attempt to build a kernel machine architecture with multiple layers of feature extraction. It composed of many layers of kernel PCA based feature extraction units with support vector machine having arc-cosine kernel as the final classifier. The other approaches like Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and deep core vector machines solve the fixed kernel computation problem and scalability aspects of MKMs respectively. In addition to this, there are lot of avenues where the use of unsupervised MKL with both single and multilayer kernels in the multilayer feature extraction framework have to be evaluated. In this context, this paper attempts to build a scalable deep kernel machines with multiple layers of feature extraction. Each kernel PCA based feature extraction layer in this framework is modeled by the combination of both single and multilayer kernels in an unsupervised manner. Core vector machine with arc-cosine kernel is used as the final layer classifier which ensure the scalability in this model. The major contribution of this paper is a novel effort to build a deep structured kernel machine architecture similar to deep neural network architecture for classification. It opens up an extendable research avenue for researchers in deep learning based intelligent system leveraging the principles of kernel theory. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently improves the generalization performances of existing deep core vector machine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.eswa.2017.11.058,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037543975&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2017.11.058&partnerID=40&md5=711c3bdc32d0c35ec10339b9e3956267,Article

The perturbation of these intracellular processes is more sensitive and highly dependent on NAMPT to maintain the required NAD levels. Functional inhibition of NAMPT is, therefore, a promising drug target in therapeutic oncology. In this study, the importance of intermolecular contacts was realized based on contact occupancy and favorable energetic from molecular dynamic simulation to discern non-critical contacts of four different classes of potential NAMPT inhibitor bound complexes. Further, pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, a quantum mechanical properties and MD simulation, as well as active site residual network communication were employed to identify potential leads. Present studies identified two leads, 2 and 3 which have better binding free energy compared to known inhibitors and showed stable hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts with β barrel cavity lining residues in the active site of the dimer interface (A′B). Lead 2 containing fluorene as central core and lead 3 having phenyl-benzamide as a core showed stable moiety which was observed from electronic property analysis. Active site residual communication in identified leads bound complex also showed similarity to known inhibitor complexes.

Amongst the biological molecules, structural DNA architectures are particularly useful due to their unrivaled ability to assume almost any desired shape along with allowing fluorophores to be precisely arranged on them with controlled stoichiometry and sub-nanometer positional accuracy. The unique properties available to joint QD-DNA composites suggest them for a host of new applications in light harvesting, biosensing, and molecular computation amongst others. To fully realize the synergistic benefits from such organic-inorganic composites, especially when they constitute complex, multidimensional Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) networks, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that govern the individual components is imperative. Here, we demonstrate hybrid FRET systems comprising an initial QD scaffold/donor displaying DNA dendrimers decorated with dyes and which are capable of efficiently capturing UV light and transporting it to spectrally and spatially distant fluorophores via multistep FRET. We evaluate two primary strategies to conjugate the DNA-dendrimers to the QDs, namely covalent attachment of DNA to the termini of the QDs surface ligands and polyhistidine-based metal affinity coordination of modified DNA to the QD's ZnS shell surface. Analysis of the resulting FRET data shows that the dendritic arrangement of the dyes and the ability to place multiple dendrimer copies around the QD's nontrivial surface provides for significant energy transfer efficiencies of 20-25% through these multi-FRET step systems. In analyzing the properties of the conjugates, we further find that each assembly chemistry brings with it a series of benefits and liabilities that serve as mutual trade-offs and potential rules of thumb for designing future nanodevices based on these materials. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/c7me00121e,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045515737&doi=10.1039%2fc7me00121e&partnerID=40&md5=7001be620197459199086a50819f586d,Article

First, we investigate the tolerance of the CV-QKD system to spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) noise, the latter being the most dominant impairment in a WDM co-existence environment for QKD. In particular, we investigate by experiment the impact of a WDM 10×times 10 Gb/s ON-OFF-keying signal in terms of induced SRS noise in the QKD channel. The spontaneous SRS noise influence is assessed for different transmission scenarios, i.e., for various optical launch powers of the WDM signal, and for different transmission links of 20, 40, 60, and 80 km. Based on the experimental data and on the measured system's parameters, we estimate the key rates and reach capabilities of the proposed CV-QKD system. The scheme supports a key rate of 90 kbit/s over 20 km, for an ideal QKD system multiplexed with 2-mW optical power.

Based on a microscopic photoluminescence analysis of green GaN-based multiple quantum wells, we find that In-enriched emission clusters on the submicrometer scale, previously thought to be efficient luminescent centers, do not emit light effectively. Such emission clusters can localize an excessively large amount of carriers, leading to the subsequent occurrence of vigorous nonradiative recombination processes. We also observe that the effective volume of the LED active region is significantly reduced, possibly because the generation of these In-enriched clusters via metastable phase separation significantly degrades the surrounding crystal quality.

However, the entangled nature of arbitrary rational-order OAM has long been considered a myth due to the absence of an effective strategy for generating arbitrary rational-order OAM beams. Therefore, we report a single metadevice comprising a bilaterally symmetric grating with an aperture, creating optical beams with dynamically controllable OAM values that are continuously varying over a rational range. Due to its encoded spiniform phase, this novel metagrating enables the production of an average OAM that can be increased without a theoretical limit by embracing distributed singularities, which differs significantly from the classic method of stacking phase singularities using fork gratings. This new method makes it possible to probe the unexplored niche of quantum entanglement between arbitrarily defined OAMs in light, which could lead to the complex manipulation of microparticles, high-dimensional quantum entanglement and optical communication. We show that quantum coincidence based on rational-order OAM-superposition states could give rise to low cross-talks between two different states that have no significant overlap in their spiral spectra.

1359,Scopus,Suomalainen et al. (2018),2018,Evaluating the efficiency of physical and cryptographic security solutions for quantum immune iot,Cryptography,"The threat of quantum-computer-assisted cryptanalysis is forcing the security community to develop new types of security protocols. These solutions must be secure against classical and post-quantum cryptanalysis techniques as well as feasible for all kinds of devices, including energy-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The quantum immunity can be implemented in the cryptographic layer, e.g., by using recent lattice-based key exchange algorithms NewHope or Frodo, or in the physical layer of wireless communication, by utilizing eavesdropping-resistant secrecy coding techniques. In this study, we explore and compare the feasibility and energy efficiency of selected cryptographic layer and physical layer approaches by applying an evaluation approach that is based on simulation and modeling. In particular, we consider NewHope and Frodo key exchange algorithms as well as novel physical layer secrecy coding approach that is based on polar codes. The results reveal that our proposed physical layer implementation is very competitive with respect to the cryptographic solutions, particularly in short-range wireless communication. We also observed that the total energy consumption is unequally divided between transmitting and receiving devices in all the studied approaches. This may be an advantage when designing security architectures for energy-restricted devices. © 2018 by the authors.

Subjects include the following: the universe has a conscious force field at all its scales, requiring continuous inter-scale communication of information; the field exhibits distinct electromagnetic frequencies associated with the building blocks of life; and advances in the technology of sound production with electronic synthesizers can be applied to study mechanisms of such universal communication. The question being addressed is how electronic synthesizers can be used to create sonic xenolinguistic expressions when composing with sonified frequencies obtained from bio-organisms, human protein structures, phonemes and various types of interstellar frequencies that include, but are not limited to, gamma bursts, pulsars and neutron stars. The objective is to construct sonic xenolingusitic expressions that can act like feedback loops within the field of consciousness. These sonic expressions can include anomalous cognitive, emotive or spiritual experiences that may be emerging out of the universal field of consciousness in real time. Xenolinguistics is a hypothetical language used to communicate with other sentient beings in the universe. The rationale for composing sonic xenolingustic expressions is the belief that the universe is considered conscious and that there is a field of consciousness existing throughout the universe that in principle is also instrumental in how communication can evolve with extraterrestrials. Outlines of other attempts at extraterrestrial communication by other researchers will be offered based on current literature. The probability that other life forms have established some mode of information exchange that is detectable and that, in return, may be able to create a form of communication to respond will be covered. It is postulated that various energy fields existing before and after the creation of our universe interacted with one another becoming abiotic, and then over time, formed even more complex structures. It is these complex structures that were then able to communicate essential information for maintaining their stability and survivability by using specific signalling frequencies. It is hypothesized that first life in the universe emerged within an already existing field of information and that our consciousness is thereby able to establish communication with other forms of consciousness in the universe. It is on this basis that a novel scientific and philosophical paradigm is considered in which the universe is conceived of as an active information matrix that can entertain potential extraterrestrial communication. In this framework, the present article will offer a new approach to orchestrated electronic sounds as a means to such communication. By integrating quantum physical properties into that sonic framework, a new study emerged on how sonic xenolinguistic elements can be incorporated into electronic composition techniques. This new framework may produce new algorithms for musical expression that not only represent an innovative future of electronic music but may also be crucial in the formulation and induction of new states of consciousness that will enable humankind to directly participate in the further becoming of the universe as a result of the evolution of this universal field of consciousness. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.",,10.1386/tear.16.1.113_1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050985080&doi=10.1386%2ftear.16.1.113_1&partnerID=40&md5=fccd83d8982668637a3f7153664a8f42,Article

It is found that the independence between different OAM modes is crucial to wireless communications. Motivated by the tremendous potential of OAM in communication systems, a novel method to generate vortex beams by spoof surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is proposed. A looped double-layer spoof SPP waveguide is applied to realize the transmission of electromagnetic waves. Beam emitting is accomplished through a series of circular patches, whose role is not only the radiation units but also resonators giving rise to the phase shifts required by the vortex beam. The proposed method is validated by both numerical simulation and experiment. The measured results show that spoof SPP are radiated by the circular patches and vortex beams carrying different OAM modes are observed at different frequencies. The proposed method possesses smaller size and is much easier to be integrated into systems and integrated circuits. The simple structure and design procedure make the proposed method promising in future wireless communication systems. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Because of technology limitations which do not allow large quantum computers to work as a single processing element, distributed quantum computation is an appropriate solution to overcome this difficulty. Previous studies have applied ad-hoc solutions to distribute a quantum system for special cases and applications. In this study, a general approach is proposed to optimize the number of teleportations for a DQC consisting of two spatially separated and long-distance quantum subsystems. To this end, different configurations of locations for executing gates whose qubits are in distinct subsystems are considered and for each of these configurations, the proposed algorithm is run to find the minimum number of required teleportations. Finally, the configuration which leads to the minimum number of teleportations is reported. The proposed method can be used as an automated procedure to find the configuration with the optimal communication cost for the DQC. This cost can be used as a basic measure of the communication cost for future works in the distributed quantum circuits. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s10773-017-3618-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037374917&doi=10.1007%2fs10773-017-3618-x&partnerID=40&md5=fca29cfd2233e79ded4bf578601db9ee,Article

They work with linear optical elements and have good feasibility in experiment, especially in the case that there are a big number of quantum data exchanged as the parties can obtain the information about the parameters of the nonlocal hyperentangled states by sampling a subset of nonlocal hyperentangled two-photon systems and measuring them.

A basic objective is to keep the required resources to implement arithmetic as low as possible. This applies in particular to the number of qubits required in the implementation as for the foreseeable future this number is expected to be small. We present a reversible circuit for integer multiplication that is inspired by Karatsuba's recursive method. The main improvement over circuits that have been previously reported in the literature is an asymptotic reduction of the amount of space required from O(n1.585) to O(n1.427). This improvement is obtained in exchange for a small constant increase in the number of operations by a factor less than 2 and a small asymptotic increase in depth for the parallel version.

However, all of this previous research seldom focused on the routing mechanism of QKD network in detail. Therefore, this paper focuses on the routing issue in trust relaying QKD network, builds a model of the trust relaying QKD network and proposes a secret-key-Aware routing method. In our method, a dynamic model for the residual local key is proposed to forecast the residual local key quantity of each QKD link more accurately, and the cost of QKD link and relaying path are defined by multiple affecting factors, e.g. the generation, consumption rate and the local key depletion index. The proposed method is implemented and evaluated in a simulation environment. The simulation results show that our routing method can increase the success rate of key exchange, make all the QKD links participate key exchange with almost equal opportunity to achieve load balance, and trade off the local key generation and consumption of each QKD link. Therefore, our proposed method can contribute to effectively improve the holistic performance of the trust relaying QKD network. © 2018 Editorial Department of China Communications.

Considering the uncertainty, complexity, and scarcity of experimental data on release, we present the development of a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model. This baseline model aims to give a first prediction of the release of nanomaterials (excluding nanofibers) during their mechanical shredding. With a focus on the description of the model development methodology, we characterize nanomaterial release in terms of number, size, mass, and composition of released particles. Through a sensitivity analysis of the model, we find the material-specific parameters like affinity of nanomaterials to the matrix of the composite and their state of dispersion inside the matrix to reduce the nanomaterial release up to 50%. The shredder-specific parameters like number of shafts in a shredder and input and output size of the material for shredding could minimize it up to 98%. The comparison with two experimental test cases shows promising outcome on the prediction capacity of the model. As additional experimental data on nanomaterial release becomes available, the model is able to further adapt and update risk forecasts. When adapting the model with additional expert beliefs, experts should be selected using criteria, e.g., substantial contribution to nanomaterial and/or particulate matter release-related scientific literature, the capacity and willingness to contribute to further development of the BBN model, and openness to accepting deviating opinions.

Many diverse electron spin systems have been studied with a view to storing quantum information, including molecular radicals, point defects and impurities in inorganic systems, and quantum dots in semiconductor devices. In these systems, spin coherence times can exceed seconds, single spins can be addressed through electrical and optical methods, and new spin systems with advantageous properties continue to be identified. Spin ensembles strongly coupled to microwave resonators can, in principle, be used to store the coherent states of single microwave photons, enabling so-called microwave quantum memories. We discuss key requirements in realising such memories, including considerations for superconducting resonators whose frequency can be tuned onto resonance with the spins. Finally, progress towards microwave quantum memories and other developments in the field of superconducting quantum devices are being used to push the limits of sensitivity of inductively-detected electron spin resonance.

Complementing the beam-hopping system principles, we discussed the physical layer transmission solutions suitable for beamhopping. Based on the identified waveform key-requirements for applying beamhopping, the already released DVB-S2X standard was reviewed and analysed using practical and representative system examples. It was found that the super-framing specification offers high practical relevance compared to the conventional DVBS2/S2X framing.

(2018),2018,Optimal Distributed Generation Allocation Using Quantum Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization,Studies in Big Data,"Distributed Generation (DG), with respect to its ability in utilizing the alternative resources of energy, provides a promising future for power generation in electrical networks. Distributed generators contribution to the power systems includes improvement in energy efficiency and power quality to reliability and security. These benefits are only achievable with optimal allocation of distributed resources that considers the objective function, constraints, and employs a suitable optimization algorithm. In this chapter, a quantum inspired computational intelligence is exercised for the optimal allocation of distributed generators. The fact that most of power system optimization problems, when modelled accurately, are of non-convex and sometimes discrete nature has encouraged many researchers to develop optimization techniques to overcome such difficulties. The basic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most favored optimization techniques with many attractive features. Early experiments of employing PSO in many applications in power systems have indicated its promising potential. Consequently, the more advanced alternatives of this algorithm such as Quantum behaved PSO (Q-PSO) may show the same or even better performance in power system problems. The aforementioned algorithm has already been employed for different optimization objectives in power systems such as: short-term non-convex economic scheduling, unit commitment problems, loss of power minimization, economic load dispatch, smart building energy management and power system operations. Nevertheless, the algorithm has never been used for optimal allocation of distributed generation units. In this chapter the above problem will be solved with a quantum behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The chapter will be started with an introduction to the optimal allocation of DG then the power system, including the DG units will be modeled. On the next step the Q-PSO will be adopted for the optimal allocation.

It also raises the question as to whether it is possible to generate entangled photons at these frequencies, as previously this has only been achieved using cryogenically cooled Josephson junctions. A homodyne interferometric receiver is proposed whereby a millimetre wave pump generates entangled photons by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a non-linear birefringent material, before the signal and idler are mixed together in a sum-frequency mixer. The output then enters a second mixer which uses the pump as the local oscillator to shift the signal and idler down to baseband, where signal integration over many successive entangled pair recovers the entanglement signature from the noise. A successful demonstration of this would mean cryogenics could be avoided, enabling more sensor architectures and deployment scenarios. Novel experiments in the millimetre wave band could lead to a deeper understanding of entanglement and offer novel schemes for secure communications and covert interrogation techniques (quantum radar and ghost imaging), exploiting the fact that the signal is below the level of the thermal noise and can only be accessed by a single user having the key, which is the pump. © 2018 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2500812,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076420130&doi=10.1117%2f12.2500812&partnerID=40&md5=e621ddd1e50076c509cfad5fcaf23d12,Conference Paper

One way to overcome these losses is via optical links to satellites, which has most prominently been demonstrated in course of the Chinese-Austrian QUESS mission. Though its findings were impressive, such a large-scale project requires massive financial and time resources. We propose a 34x10x10cm nanosatellite orders of magnitude cheaper which is able to perform QKD in a trusted-node scenario, using only commercially available components. We have performed a detailed analysis of such a CubeSat mission (""Q3Sat""), finding that cost and complexity can be reduced by sending the photons from ground to satellite, i.e. using an uplink. Calculations have been done for a prepare-and-send protocol (BB84 with decoy pulses) using polarization as information carrier. We have created a preliminary design of a 3U CubeSat including a detailed size, weight and power budget and a CAD to account for the assembly of the components. Deploying a 10 cm long mirror telescope covering the small surface of the satellite leaves enough space for a polarization analysis module and housekeeping, communication and computing electronics. For one such CubeSat, we estimate the quantum secure key to be acquired between two ground stations during one year to be about 13 Mbit. A Bell test between ground and satellite would also be feasible. The uplink design allows to keep the more sensitive, computation-intensive and expensive devices on ground. The experiment proposed by us therefore poses a comparably low-threshold quantum space mission. For a two-year lifetime of the satellite, the price per kilobit would amount to about 20 Euro. In large constellations, Q3Sats could be used to establish a global quantum network, which would further lower the cost. Summarizing, our detailed design and feasibility study can be readily used as a template for global-scale quantum communication. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2535986,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072659767&doi=10.1117%2f12.2535986&partnerID=40&md5=55d22f655a41b24e89ecaf9dbbfc9065,Conference Paper

The team is developing technologies such as QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) which harness unique properties of quantum physics to enable highly secured encryption services. QKD can generate encryption keys that are secure against computational hacks and that can be distributed to remote parties with solid guarantees that they have not been intercepted by man-in-the-middle eavesdroppers. Currently, most encryption keys derive their security from complex mathematical functions that require unfeasibly large classical computers to crack, but quantum computers are coming online soon that will compromise many of these keys. Since QKD derives its security from fundamental physical laws it is provably secure against future computational developments. QKD requires that information be transmitted optically, typically with bits encoded in individual photons that must be uniquely distinguished and timestamped at the transmitter and receiver. Accordingly, the signals are very weak and susceptible to loss compared with classical laser communications. Within optical fibres they are restricted to distances of 50-100km before physically secured, trusted repeater stations are required. Using free-space optics the losses are lower and by delivering QKD from space the entire world can be connected securely. © 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

With the recent success of space based experimental QKD systems, researchers are now focussing on implementing more practical and efficient QKD systems that meet the challenges faced in space-based implementations. One pressing problem is the need for efficient and easy to implement reconciliation schemes for practical QKD systems. Rate-adaptive schemes based on LDPC codes constitute an appealing implementation of the key reconciliation process since they cover the entire range of the channel parameter space with a limited set of pre-defined Mother codes. In this paper, we investigate in detail some rate- adaptive reconciliation schemes based on LDPC codes, illustrating how their performance compares to other set-ups in which fixed-rate non- adaptive LDPC codes optimised for different channel conditions are adopted. In particular, the impact rate-adaptive codes have on decoding complexity, and subsequently the overall secure key throughput, is quantified through full blown simulations of an entanglement-based version of the QKD protocol within the context of an entanglement source onboard a satellite. Our work highlights that even though rate adaptive schemes schemes for QKD reconciliation appear ideal for future space-based implementations of single- photon QKD, identification of ideal Mother codes for such schemes remains to be resolved. © 2018 IEEE.",,10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647658,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063497935&doi=10.1109%2fGLOCOM.2018.8647658&partnerID=40&md5=95afd61a731d4febabbf94ce160b1070,Conference Paper

Aiming at this problem, a software package Geant4 is applied in the simulation, furthermore, an algorithm based on the basic Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and typical polarization Monte Carlo model is proposed, the algorithm is used to simulate the polarization state when the laser is propagating underwater at different concentrations of water or transmission length. At the same time, the experiment is tested in a sink whose length is 10m and the polarization state detector is a laser power meter with accuracy up to 10nW. In this paper, the change of polarization state is expressed by the depolarization ratio.

Generally, evaporation is measured using the direct method where Class A pan-evaporimeter is used, and an indirect method that includes empirical equations. However, despite its widespread usage, Class A pan-evaporimeter method can be affected by human and instrumentation errors. Empirical equations, on the other hand, are generally linked to the different climatic factors that should provide initial or boundary conditions in the mathematical equations that affect the rate of evaporation. Considering these challenging, heuristic soft computing approaches that do not need key information about the physics of evaporation. In this study, a Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, embedded into a multi-layer perceptron technique, is developed to estimate the evaporation rates over a daily forecast horizon. The measured evaporation data from 2012–2014 for Talesh meteorological station located in Northern Iran are employed. The predictive accuracy of the MLP-QPSO model is evaluated with existing methods: i.e. a hybrid MLP-PSO and a standalone MLP model. The results are evaluated in respect to statistical performance criterion: the mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE), Willmott’s Index and the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient. In conjunction with these metrics, Taylor diagrams are also utilized to assess the level of agreement between the forecasted and observed evaporation data. Evidently, the hybrid MLP-QPSO model is confirmed to be an optimal forecasting tool applied for estimating daily pan evaporation, outperforming both the hybrid MLP-PSO and the standalone model.In light of these results, the present study justifies the potential utility of the hybrid MLP-QPSO model to be applied for estimating daily evaporation rates in North of Iran. © 2018 The Author(s).",,10.1080/19942060.2018.1517052,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058654954&doi=10.1080%2f19942060.2018.1517052&partnerID=40&md5=0e2778829988613b20cc19e77c4e7265,Article

To resolve the above problems, a combination of metal dichalcogenides with conductive scaffolds as high-performance electrode materials has aroused tremendous interest recently. Herein, we synthesize a 3D honeycomb-like rGO anchored with SnS2 quantum dots (3D SnS2 QDs/rGO) composite via spray-drying and sulfidation. The unique 3D-ordered honeycomb-like structure can confine the volume change of SnS2 QDs in the lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes, provide enough space for electrolyte reservoirs, promote the conductivity of the SnS2 QDs, and improve the electron transfer. As a result, the 3D SnS2 QDs/rGO composite electrode delivers a high capacity and long cycling stability (862 mAh/g for LIB at 0.1 A/g after 200 cycles, 233 mAh/g for SIB at 0.5 A/g after 200 cycles).

Along these lines, ITS aim at providing sophisticated management models and tools across all transport modes. Therefore designing models that resist future attacks is an important area of research and standardization, in particular in our project Secure Cooperative Autonomous systems in relation to the domain of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems. So it is far from easy due to the high complexity of these systems. To preserve the security properties of today's communications against future attacks, protocols must begin to explore the new challenges to design and implement crypto-agility, which has the ability to switch easily from an obsolete cryptographic algorithm to another. To achieve these challenges, we introduce properties for the crypto-agility in order to allow designers to develop generic models, while providing more agility and significantly reducing the development cycle.

To achieve highly efficient light-emitting devices, not only the high-quality materials but also a deep understanding of their growth mechanisms and material properties (structural, optical, and electrical) are extremely critical. In particular, the three-dimensional growth mechanism of MQWs embedded in a NW structure by SAE is expected to be different from that of those grown in a planar structure or with a catalyst and has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we reveal a distinctive radial growth evolution of InGaAs/InP MQW NWs grown by the SAE metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) technique. We observe the formation of zinc blende (ZB) QW discs induced by the axial InGaAs QW growth on the wurtzite (WZ) base-InP NW and propose it as the key factor driving the overall structure of radial growth. The role of the ZB-to-WZ change in the driving of the overall growth evolution is supported by a growth formalism, taking into account the formation-energy difference between different facets. Despite a polytypic crystal structure with mixed ZB and WZ phases across the MQW region, the NWs exhibit high uniformity and desirable QW spatial layout with bright room-temperature photoluminescence at an optical communication wavelength of ∼1.3 μm, which is promising for the future development of high-efficiency light-emitting devices. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

Specifically, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) deals with the problem of distributing unconditionally-secure cryptographic keys between two parties. Enabling this technology from space is a critical step for developing a truly-secure global communication network. The National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT, Japan) performed the first successful measurement on the ground of a quantum-limited signal from a satellite in experiments carried out on early August in 2016. The SOTA (Small Optical TrAnsponder) lasercom terminal onboard the LEO satellite SOCRATES (Space Optical Communications Research Advanced Technology Satellite) was utilized for this purpose. Two non-orthogonally polarized signals in the ∼800-nm band and modulated at 10 MHz were transmitted by SOTA and received in the single-photon regime by using a 1-m Cassegrain telescope on a ground station located in an urban area of Tokyo (Japan). In these experiments, after compensating the Doppler effect induced by the fast motion of the satellite, a QKD-enabling QBER (Quantum Bit Error Rate) below 5% was measured with estimated key rates in the order of several Kbit/s, proving the feasibility of quantum communications in a real scenario from space for the first time. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Both types of systems are based on electro-magnetic waves, differing only in carrier frequency. It is, in fact, the frequency that determines which of these limits dominates. We explore this in the first part of this paper. This leads to a difference in methods of analysis of the two different types of systems. While equations predicting the probability of bit error for RF systems are usually based on the signal to background noise ratio, similar equations for optical systems are often based on the physics of the quantum limit and are simply a function of the detected signal energy received per bit. These equations are derived in the second part of this paper for several frequently used modulation schemes: On-off keying (OOK), pulse position modulation (PPM), and binary differential phase shift keying (DPSK). While these equations ignore the effects of background noise and non-quantum internal noise sources in the detector and receiver electronics, they provide a useful bound for obtainable performance of optical communication systems. For example, these equations may be used in initial link budgets to assess the feasibility of system architectures, even before specific receiver designs are considered. © 2018 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2296850,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048436253&doi=10.1117%2f12.2296850&partnerID=40&md5=63ca40ac2c27cd76755026104d84c250,Conference Paper

Compared to YAG, GaN has a higher thermal conductivity, lower thermal expansion coefficient, and lower temperature coefficient of the refractive index (dn/dT) around 1.5 μm. Hence, HELs based on erbium doped GaN (Er:GaN) are expected to outperform those based on Er:YAG in terms of average power, power density, temperature stability and beam quality. Here, we provide a brief overview on the progress made in authors' laboratory for the realization of freestanding Er:GaN wafers of 2-inches in diameter with a thickness on the millimeter scale. These freestanding wafers were obtained via growth by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) in conjunction with a laser-lift-off process. Optical absorption and resonantly excited photoluminescence emission spectra have enabled the construction of energy level diagrams pertaining to the excitation and emission mechanisms of Er:GaN eye-safe HELs operating around 1.5 μm. The results have shown that the common excitation and emission scheme of Er:YAG is not entirely applicable to achieve Er:GaN eye-safe lasers.

Quantum keys with different error rates were used to conduct encryption and decryption of three 720p single-screen video images. Moreover, the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the original and decrypted images was calculated.

The ability of these algorithms to detect complex patterns in data which are extremely difficult to achieve manually, helps to produce effective predictive models.

(2018),2018,Post-quantum zero-knowledge proofs for accumulators with applications to ring signatures from symmetric-key primitives,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"In this paper we address the construction of privacy-friendly cryptographic primitives for the post-quantum era and in particular accumulators with zero-knowledge membership proofs and ring signatures. This is an important topic as it helps to protect the privacy of users in online authentication or emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies. Recently, we have seen first such constructions, mostly based on assumptions related to codes and lattices. We, however, ask whether it is possible to construct such primitives without relying on structured hardness assumptions, but solely based on symmetric-key primitives such as hash functions or block ciphers. This is interesting because the resistance of latter primitives to quantum attacks is quite well understood. In doing so, we choose a modular approach and firstly construct an accumulator (with one-way domain) that allows to efficiently prove knowledge of (a pre-image of) an accumulated value in zero-knowledge. We, thereby, take care that our construction can be instantiated solely from symmetric-key primitives and that our proofs are of sublinear size. Latter is non trivial to achieve in the symmetric setting due to the absence of algebraic structures which are typically used in other settings to make these efficiency gains. Regarding efficient instantiations of our proof system, we rely on recent results for constructing efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for general circuits. Based on this building block, we then show how to construct logarithmic size ring signatures solely from symmetric-key primitives. As constructing more advanced primitives only from symmetric-key primitives is a very recent field, we discuss some interesting open problems and future research directions. Finally, we want to stress that our work also indirectly impacts other fields: for the first time it raises the requirement for collision resistant hash functions with particularly low AND count. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",,10.1007/978-3-319-79063-3_20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045379297&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-79063-3_20&partnerID=40&md5=1a935ee52da6cc0b3baa933b9a87d5e1,Conference Paper

This paper discusses simulations under a variety of environmental and climate scenarios. Simulations demonstrate the capability of Raman lidar deployed on-board low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide global-scale water vapour mixing ratio and temperature measurements in the lower to middle troposphere, with accuracies exceeding most observational requirements for numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate research applications. These performances are especially attractive for measurements in the low troposphere in order to close the most critical gaps in the current earth observation system. In all climate zones, considering vertical and horizontal resolutions of 200 m and 50 km, respectively, mean water vapour mixing ratio profiling precision from the surface up to an altitude of 4 km is simulated to be 10%, while temperature profiling precision is simulated to be 0.40-0.75 K in the altitude interval up to 15 km. Performances in the presence of clouds are also simulated. Measurements are also possible above and below cirrus clouds with an optical thickness of 0.3. This combination of accuracy and vertical resolution cannot be achieved with any other space borne remote sensing technique and will provide a breakthrough in our knowledge of global and regional water and energy cycles as well as in the quality of short- to mediumrange weather forecasts.

Making use of quantum nondemolition detection gates constructed with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity, our protocol has some attractive advantages. First, the parties can recover less-entangled SPE to be maximally entangled SPE, and reduce photon loss simultaneously. Second, if the protocol fails, the parties can repeat the protocol to reuse some discarded items, which can increase the success probability. Third, when the protocol is successful, they can similarly repeat the protocol to further increase the fidelity of the SPE. Thereby, our protocol provides a possible way to obtain high entanglement, high fidelity and high success probability simultaneously. In particular, our protocol shows higher success probability in the practical high photon loss channel.

This protocol has a higher capacity than previous QSDC protocols because each photon pair can carry 6 bits of information, not just 2 or 4 bits. Our QSDC protocol decreases the influence of decoherence from environment noise by exploiting the decoy photons to check the security of the transmission of the first photon sequence. Compared with two-way QSDC protocols, our QSDC protocol is immune to an attack by an eavesdropper using Trojan horse attack strategies because it is a one-way quantum communication.

Multi-Valued Logic (MVL) provides one such opportunity, since efficient implementation of MVL can allow compact and enhanced information processing and be orders of magnitude efficient than binary CMOS. Emerging devices such as Quantum Dots, Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), Carbon Nanotube FETs (CNTFETs), Spin Wave Devices etc., provide an avenue for hardware implementation of MVL. So far, MVL lagged behind CMOS due to (a) complexities associated with traditional logic decomposition approaches, which result in many MVL minterms, complex polynomials of order greater than two, and cumbersome decision diagrams that are difficult to implement, and (b) multi-valued data representation, processing and communication using binary switches and medium, which are inefficient. In this paper, we propose a transformative new direction for multi-valued logic decomposition (problem (a)) utilizing concepts from machine learning and nanoelectronics. In our approach, given a MVL function, we perform iterative linear regressions on all input and output combinations to derive a set of linear expressions. A visual pattern matching technique is then applied to derive selection conditions for each linear expression based on the function inputs. The set of linear expressions and corresponding selection criteria ensure that for all function inputs, correct outputs are obtained. The resulting linear expressions are hardware implementation friendly and can be implemented with simple gates and summation functions. In this paper, we show an approach to solve (b) by implementing a quaternary multiplier using our technique.

Therefore, it is a necessary and meaningful task for ensuring the high security and efficiency of microwave-based quantum communication in practice. Here, we present an original polarization entanglement purification protocol for nonlocal microwave photons based on the cross-Kerr effect in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Our protocol can solve the problem that the purity of maximally entangled states used for constructing quantum channels will decrease due to decoherence from environment noise. This task is accomplished by means of the polarization parity-check quantum nondemolition (QND) detector, the bit-flipping operation, and the linear microwave elements. The QND detector is composed of several cross-Kerr effect systems which can be realized by coupling two superconducting transmission line resonators to a superconducting molecule with the N-type level structure.

In recent years, due to the possible applications of quantum communication technologies in military, finance, medicine and other fields, quantum dialogue has been widely concerned. In the year of 2017, NR Zhou et al designed a new quantum dialogue protocol by using the continuous-variable two-mode squeezed vacuum states, where the two communication parties encode their own secret information into the entangled optical modes with the translation operations and each communication party could deduce the secret information of their counterparts with the help of his or her secret information and the Bellbasis measurement results [1]. LH Gong et al devised an efficient three-party quantum dialogue protocol based on the continuous variable GHZ entangled states [2]. NR Zhou et al proposed a secure quantum dialogue protocol based on single-photons, which not only overcomes information leakage but also possesses an acceptable efficiency. M Xiao et al presented a novel quantum dialogue protocol without information leakage over the collective noise channel, where the logical qubits and four-qubit decoherence-free states were introduced to resist against collective-dephasing noise, collective-rotation noise and all kinds of unitary collective noise [4]. T Hwang et al proposed an authenticated quantum dialogue based on Bell states, allowing two communicators to perform mutual authentication and secure bidirectional communications simultaneously via public classical channels [5]. TY Ye proposed a quantum dialogue scheme by employing logical Bell states as the quantum resource to combat the collective-dephasing noise and the collective-rotation noise, which can accomplish the mutual identification and the dialogue between two participants simultaneously and securely over one kind of collective noise channels [6]. M Wang et al proposed a quantum dialogue protocol based on four-qubit entangled state, which is constructed by an EPR pair and two different single qubits through three Controlled-Not gates [7]. By using Bell measurements and the corresponding unitary operations, two users can exchange their messages simultaneously and directly without sharing any secret keys beforehand. The above protocols exploited different quantum states and involved two or three communication parties basically. These protocols cannot satisfy the practical applications of quantum dialogue in future possible quantum communication networks. Therefore, we will propose a multiparty continuous variable quantum dialogue protocol. Multiparty quantum dialogue protocol enables multiple communication parties to transmit and/or receive information at the same time. The protocol could ensure that there is no information leakage in the communication process according to the uncertainty principle and quantum non-cloning theorem. © 2017 IEEE.",,10.1109/NANO.2017.8117397,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041193701&doi=10.1109%2fNANO.2017.8117397&partnerID=40&md5=7b03dfef2b7355700883bdcc49c83f52,Conference Paper

Quantum light-matter interfaces that reversibly map the quantum state of photons onto the quantum states of atoms, are essential components in the quantum engineering toolbox with applications in optical quantum networks for distributing quantum entanglement and interconnecting future quantum computers. In this talk I present our progress towards developing on-chip quantum light-matter interfaces based on nanophotonic resonators fabricated in rare-earth-doped crystals known to exhibit some of the longest optical and spin coherence times in the solid state. We recently demonstrated coherent control of neodymium (Nd3+) ions coupled to yttrium orthosilicate Y2SiO5 (YSO) photonic crystal nano-beam resonators. The coupling of the Nd3+ 883 nm4I9/2-4F3/2 transition to the nano-resonator results in a 40 fold enhancement of the transition rate (Purcell effect), and increased optical absorption (~80%) - adequate for realizing efficient optical quantum memories via cavity impedance matching. Optical coherence times T2 up to 100 µs with low spectral diffusion were measured for ions embedded in photonic crystals, which are comparable to those observed in unprocessed bulk samples. This indicates that the remarkable coherence properties of REIs are preserved during nanofabrication process. Multi-temporal mode photon storage using stimulated photon echo and atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocols were implemented in these nano-resonators.

Here, the intriguing functionalities of wrinkled reduced graphene oxide, single-layer graphene, and few-layer hexagonal boron nitride, respectively, are utilized to design highly stretchable and wearable random laser devices with ultralow threshold. Using methyl-ammonium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (PNC) to illustrate the working principle, the lasing threshold is found to be ≈10 µJ cm−2, about two times less than the lowest value ever reported. In addition to PNC, it is demonstrated that the output lasing wavelength can be tuned using different active materials such as semiconductor quantum dots.

After presenting the general framework of the mechanism, we show the phenomenon in some concrete simple examples in the randomly connected tensor network, which is tightly related to a certain model of quantum gravity, i.e., the canonical tensor model. We find large peaks at configurations invariant under Lie-group symmetries as well as a preference for charge quantization, even in the Abelian case. In future study, this simple mechanism may provide a way to analyze the emergence of macroscopic space-times with global symmetries as well as various other symmetries existing in nature, which are usually postulated. © 2017, The Author(s).",,10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5355-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035218595&doi=10.1140%2fepjc%2fs10052-017-5355-y&partnerID=40&md5=2070cd3cb42497368ee6fe3e007aca54,Article

While the implementation of AI systems using computer algorithms of neural networks is emerging rapidly, scientists are just taking the very first steps in the development of the hardware elements of an artificial brain, specifically neuromorphic microchips. In this review article, we present the current state of the art of neuromorphic photonic circuits based on solid-state optoelectronic oscillators formed by nanoscale double barrier quantum well resonant tunneling diodes. We address, both experimentally and theoretically, the key dynamic properties of recently developed artificial solid-state neuron microchips with delayed perturbations and describe their role in the study of neural activity and regenerative memory. This review covers our recent research work on excitable and delay dynamic characteristics of both single and autaptic (delayed) artificial neurons including all-or-none response, spike-based data encoding, storage, signal regeneration and signal healing. Furthermore, the neural responses of these neuromorphic microchips display all the signatures of extended spatio-temporal localized structures (LSs) of light, which are reviewed here in detail. By taking advantage of the dissipative nature of LSs, we demonstrate potential applications in optical data reconfiguration and clock and timing at high-speeds and with short transients. The results reviewed in this article are a key enabler for the development of high-performance optoelectronic devices in future high-speed brain-inspired optical memories and neuromorphic computing. © 2017 Author(s).",,10.1063/1.5008888,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032925581&doi=10.1063%2f1.5008888&partnerID=40&md5=659ed9ea5c68fd579a281271f4ca15f9,Article

Among the key range of attacks that take place, HTTP flood DDoS attacks are on high. In the case of DDoS attacks based on HTTP flood, unusual quantum of requests are sent to the servers within quick time interval and it affects the response and the performance levels of the server. There are numerous solutions in contemporary literature, pertaining to thwarting HTTP flood kind of attacks. It is imperative from the analysis that there are constraints in the existing models since the most of these models are user session based and/or packet flow patterns. The session based evolution models are vulnerable to botnets and packet flow pattern based models are vulnerable if attack sources are equipped with human resource and/or proxy servers. Hence, there is inherent need for improving the solutions towards addressing the HTTP flood kind of attacks over the system. The crux for such system is about ensuring that fast and early detection with minimal false alarming in streaming network transactions, and ensures that the genuine requests are not impacted. To address such a system, the model of Bio-Inspired Anomaly based HTTP-flood detection aimed, and the proposed model depicted in detail along with experimental inputs.

GBLA research examines patterns of behaviors evident in game data logs for the measurement of implicit learning—the development of unarticulated knowledge that is not yet expressible on a test or formal assessment. This paper reports on the study of two digital games showing how the combination of human coding with EDM has enabled researchers to measure implicit learning of Physics. In the game Impulse, researchers combined human coding of video with educational data mining to create a set of automated detectors of students' implicit understanding of Newtonian mechanics. For Quantum Spectre, an optics puzzle game, human coding of Interaction Networks was used to identify common student errors. Findings show that several of our measures of student implicit learning within these games were significantly correlated with improvements in external postassessments. Methods and detailed findings were different for each type of game. These results suggest GBLA shows promise for future work such as adaptive games and in-class, data-driven formative assessments, but design of the assessment mechanics must be carefully crafted for each game. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.043,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018450823&doi=10.1016%2fj.chb.2017.03.043&partnerID=40&md5=4ddb167fa1de34dde5db7c1d20f27ff2,Article

(2017),2017,Post-quantum zero-knowledge and signatures from symmetric-key primitives,Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"We propose a new class of post-quantum digital signature schemes that: (a) derive their security entirely from the security of symmetric-key primitives, believed to be quantum-secure, and (b) have extremely small keypairs, and, (c) are highly parameterizable. In our signature constructions, the public key is an image y = f (x) of a one-way function f and secret key x. A signature is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of x, that incorporates a message to be signed. For this proof, we leverage recent progress of Giacomelli et al. (USENIX'16) in constructing an efficient Ó-protocol for statements over general circuits. We improve this Ó-protocol to reduce proof sizes by a factor of two, at no additional computational cost. While this is of independent interest as it yields more compact proofs for any circuit, it also decreases our signature sizes. We consider two possibilities to make the proof non-interactive: The Fiat-Shamir transform and Unruh's transform (EUROCRYPT'12, '15,'16). The former has smaller signatures, while the latter has a security analysis in the quantum-accessible random oracle model. By customizing Unruh's transform to our application, the overhead is reduced to 1.6x when compared to the Fiat-Shamir transform, which does not have a rigorous post-quantum security analysis. We implement and benchmark both approaches and explore the possible choice of f , taking advantage of the recent trend to strive for practical symmetric ciphers with a particularly low number of multiplications and end up using LowMC (EUROCRYPT'15). © 2017 author(s).",,10.1145/3133956.3133997,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033712703&doi=10.1145%2f3133956.3133997&partnerID=40&md5=d5e5adb5bd1c3c514e420cc53c5565eb,Conference Paper

Critical to almost every potential application is an efficient mechanism for the high fidelity readout of the state of the electronic and nuclear spins. Typically such readout has been achieved through an optically resonant fluorescence measurement, but the presence of decay through a meta-stable state will limit its efficiency to the order of 99%. While this is good enough for many applications, it is insufficient for large scale quantum networks and fault-tolerant computational tasks. Here we explore an alternative approach based on dipole induced transparency (state-dependent reflection) in an NV center cavity QED system, using the most recent knowledge of the NV center's parameters to determine its feasibility, including the decay channels through the meta-stable subspace and photon ionization. We find that single-shot measurements above fault-tolerant thresholds should be available in the strong coupling regime for a wide range of cavity-center cooperativities, using a majority voting approach utilizing single photon detection.

We consider interactive protocols for wiretap II channel with active adversary who can eavesdrop and add adversarial noise to the eavesdropped part of the codeword. These channels capture wireless setting where malicious eavesdroppers at reception distance of the transmitter can eavesdrop the communication and introduce jamming signal to the channel.

With the development of highly compact circuits, the isolation between each terminal of a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system becomes more and more important to reach high system accuracy. Here, we propose an innovative approach of decoupling for a dual-band MSA, in which the isolation is achieved through two kinds of transmission lines based on the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and miniaturized spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP). Both SIW and SSPP transmission lines have been used in functional devices and could be considered as part of radio frequency front-end circuits. Using the proposed method, the isolation between two ports of MSA is achieved without occupying extra space. A prototype is fabricated on the basis of a triple-layer dual-band MSA, each port of which is connected to one of the novel transmission lines. Combining the perfectly high-pass SIW and low-pass SSPP, the proposed feeding network could provide broadband decoupling without influencing the property of the antenna. We show that the mutual coupling between two ports is decreased by almost 20 dB within a wide frequency band. Such a design could meet the needs in application of multiantenna or tunable system without further alteration in dimensions and has potential to play an important role in the future communication systems. © 2017 IEEE.",,10.1109/TAP.2017.2742539,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028513051&doi=10.1109%2fTAP.2017.2742539&partnerID=40&md5=b91486f7b89573d1ff1bd72e96dfbd4e,Article

On the other hand deterministic techniques such as gradient descent exhibit a fast convergence rate around global optimum but may get stuck in a local optimum. Motivated by these problems, a hybrid learning algorithm combining genetic algorithm (GA) with gradient descent (GD), called HGAGD, is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm combines the global exploration ability of GA with the accurate local exploitation ability of GD to achieve a faster convergence and also a better accuracy of final solution. The HGAGD is then used to train a qubit neural network (QNN), which is a good candidate for enhancing the computational efficiency of conventional neural networks, for two different applications. Firstly, a benchmark function is chosen to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in dealing with function approximation problem. Subsequently, the feasibility of the proposed method in designing an indirect adaptive controller for damping of low frequency oscillations in power systems is studied. The results of these studies show that the proposed controller trained by the HGAGD can achieve satisfactory control performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.engappai.2017.08.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028474835&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2017.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=532c26f8c9e1d2323742e9509d69dbcc,Article

However, the variation of reference frames, e.g., polarization and phase reference, would be an acute threat to the performance of MDI systems. Here, based on polarization scrambling units, we demonstrate a reference-frame-independent MDI QKD scheme that is inherently stable against volatile channel conditions; therefore, the final secure key rate will be insensitive to the random disturbances of polarization and the drifts of phase reference. Thus, calibrations of the primary reference frames are intrinsically removed in our scheme, which essentially reduces potential vulnerabilities as well as the resource consumption of the whole system. In addition, a proof-of-principle experiment with an improved fluctuation analysis method is demonstrated to verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed scheme. © 2017 Optical Society of America.",,10.1364/OPTICA.4.001016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029853365&doi=10.1364%2fOPTICA.4.001016&partnerID=40&md5=aa9524a2f5316501e374919a0166ea1d,Article
1470,Scopus,Xiong et al. (2017),2017,Experimental simulation of a quantum channel without the rotating-wave approximation: Testing quantum temporal steering,Optica,"We experimentally simulate a quantum channel in a linear optical setup, which is modeled by a two-level system (i.e., qubit) interacting with a bosonic bath. Unlike the traditional works, we treat the system–bath interaction without applying the Born approximation, the Markov approximation, or the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental simulation of a quantum channel without any of the approximations mentioned above by using linear optical devices. This non-RWA channel provides a more accurate picture of the quantum open-system dynamics. It not only reveals the effect of the counterrotating terms but also enables us to consider arbitrarily strong coupling regimes. With the proposed channel, we further experimentally investigate the dynamics of the quantum temporal steering (TS), i.e., a temporal analog of Einstein–Podolsky– Rosen steering. The experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement and show that the counterrotating terms significantly influence the TS dynamics. The TS in non-RWA and RWA channels presents different dynamics. However, we emphasize that the results without RWA are closer to realistic situations and thus more reliable. Due to the close relationship between TS and the security of the quantum cryptographic protocols, our findings are expected to have useful applications in secure quantum communications. This work also inspires future interest in studying other quantum coherence properties in the non-RWA channels. © 2017 Optical Society of America.",,10.1364/OPTICA.4.001065,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029821324&doi=10.1364%2fOPTICA.4.001065&partnerID=40&md5=6533ce2ed350b3c24817ffee6c4087e7,Article

The quantum computing theory is applied to tackle some new issues rising from ADP. In details, the unit states in a WUC problem are expressed by the quantum superposition. Then, the collapsing principle of quantum measurement is applied to solve the Bellman equation of ADP speedily. Based on the quantum rotation gate, the pre-decision states of the ADP are generated by quantum amplitude amplification technology. In the proposal algorithm, the quantum computation balances between state space exploration and exploitation automatically. Test cases of WUC are performed to verify the feasibility of the proposal approximate algorithm for the range of 10 to 100 units with 24-hour with ramp rate constraints. The experimental results show that the QI-ADP algorithm can find the sub-optimal solutions of large scale WUC problems within a reasonable time, and the average operational cost is reduced by 9.38% when the wind power is consumed. As a result, it is feasible to use the quantum computing theory to tackle some new issues rising from ADP, and the QI-ADP can be applied to solve large-scale WUC problems. © 2017 IEEE.",,10.1109/ICSGSC.2017.8038556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032358467&doi=10.1109%2fICSGSC.2017.8038556&partnerID=40&md5=29b0f3c34533315e2f693f94534134b6,Conference Paper

Within the platform, joint quantum states have to be mediated either by single photons, photon pairs or entangled photon pairs. The photon wavelength has to lie within the telecommunication band to enable long-distance fibre transmission. In addition, the temporal shape of the photons needs to be tailored to efficiently match the involved quantum systems. Altogether, this requires the efficient coherent wavelength-conversion of arbitrarily shaped single-photon wave packets. Here, we demonstrate the heralded temporal filtering of single photons as well as the synchronisation of state manipulation and detection as key elements in a typical experiment, besides of delaying a photon in a long fibre. All three are realised by utilising commercial telecommunication fibre-optical components which will permit the transition of quantum networks from the lab to real-world applications.

Despite tremendous progress in power output, which now exceeds 1 mW in pulsed and 10 mW in continuous-wave regimes at room temperature, knowledge of the major figure of merits of these devices for high-precision spectroscopy, such as spectral purity and absolute frequency tunability, is still lacking. By exploiting a metrological grade system comprising a terahertz frequency comb synthesizer, we measure, for the first time, the free-running emission linewidth (LW), the tuning characteristics, and the absolute center frequency of individual emission lines of these sources with an uncertainty of 4 × 10-10. The unveiled emission LW (400 kHz at 1-ms integration time) indicates that DFG-QCLs are well suited to operate as local oscillators and to be used for a variety of metrological, spectroscopic, communication, and imaging applications that require narrow-LW THz sources.

In order to combine their advantages and try to overcome their disadvantages, chaos synchronization is used to avoid the key transmission for the proposed semi-symmetric image encryption scheme. Our scheme is a hybrid chaotic encryption algorithm, and it consists of a scrambling stage and a diffusion stage. The control law and the update rule of function projective synchronization between the 3-cell quantum cellular neural networks (QCNN) response system and the 6th-order cellular neural network (CNN) drive system are formulated. Since the function projective synchronization is used to synchronize the response system and drive system, Alice and Bob got the key by two different chaotic systems independently and avoid the key transmission by some extra security links, which prevents security key leakage during the transmission.

Specifically, nonlinear (third-order) interactions in on-chip microring resonators have been widely used to achieve classical frequency combs [4], mode-lock lasers [5], signal processing [6], etc. Integrated photonics can also find applications for quantum state generation in compact, scalable and efficient devices, required for future optical quantum circuits.

Most importantly, in contrast to non-resonant waveguides, where individuals photon-pairs, featured by one signal/idler frequency pair, are generally produced, resonant nonlinear cavities (e.g., microring resonators) allow the generation of correlated photon-pairs on multiple signal/idler frequency channels [9], due to their periodic and equidistant resonance structure. © 2017 IEEE.",,10.1109/PHOSST.2017.8012710,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029360019&doi=10.1109%2fPHOSST.2017.8012710&partnerID=40&md5=7c42b990899687de2e3dd0959cd47ceb,Conference Paper

As a common social science practice, the ingredient at the heart of the social interaction, interdependence, is statistically removed prior to the replication of social experiments; but, as an analogy, statistically removing social interdependence to better study the individual is like statistically removing quantum effects as a complication to the study of the atom. Further, in applications of Shannon's information theory to teams, the effects of interdependence are minimized, but even there, interdependence is how classical information is transmitted. Consequently, numerous mistakes are made when applying non-interdependent models to policies, the law and regulations, impeding social welfare by failing to exploit the power of social interdependence. For example, adding redundancy to human teams is thought by subjective social network theorists to improve the efficiency of a network, easily contradicted by our finding that redundancy is strongly associated with corruption in non-free markets. Thus, built atop the individual, most of the social sciences, economics, and social network theory have little if anything to contribute to the engineering of hybrid teams. In defense of the social sciences, the mathematical physics of interdependence is elusive, non-intuitive and non-rational. However, by replacing determinism with bistable states, interdependence at the social level mirrors entanglement at the quantum level, suggesting the applicability of quantum tools for social science. We report how our quantum-like models capture some of the essential aspects of interdependence, a tool for the metrics of hybrid teams; as an example, we find additional support for our model of the solution to the open problem of team size. We also report on progress with the theory of computational emotion for hybrid teams, linking it qualitatively to the second law of thermodynamics.

In principle, this protocol can be used to classify high dimensional vectors and may provide a new viewpoint and application for future “big data”. © 2017",,10.1016/j.scib.2017.06.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025607154&doi=10.1016%2fj.scib.2017.06.007&partnerID=40&md5=6a7c741e85271eea5e8e070c3c32ab7f,Article

Besides that, nanoscale optical wireless channels including visible light spectrum are alternatives to radio-frequency communications promising energy efficiency and high data rates. In this article, vibrating multi-layer graphene nanoelectromechanical resonators are combined with designed vibrating Forster resonance energy transfer (VFRET) mechanism to achieve a nanoscale acousto-optic modulator converting vibrations to multi-color photon emissions. The frequency, color and the vibration sensitivity of emission are tunable while vibrations are realized either passively or actively by exploiting acoustic, thermo-acoustic or opto-acoustic properties of graphene. The light is generated by FRET mechanism with oscillating donor-acceptor distance where donor molecules attached on graphene are chosen as CdSe/ZnS core-shell QDs with significant properties of broad absorption spectrum, large cross-sections, tunable emission spectra, size dependent emission wavelength, high photochemical stability and improved quantum yield. The designed modulator achieves acoustic and ultrasound frequencies between several KHz and tens of MHz and radiation power reaching several nanowatts with resonator sizes of hundreds of micrometers for ambient light intensity of 0.1 W/m2/nm.

Here, we show that optical emission from individual quantum emitters in hBN is spatially correlated with structural defects and can display ultranarrow zero-phonon line width down to 45 μeV if spectral diffusion is effectively eliminated by proper surface passivation. We demonstrate that undesired emission into phonon sidebands is largely absent for this type of emitter. In addition, magneto-optical characterization reveals cycling optical transitions with an upper bound for the g-factor of 0.2 ± 0.2. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations predict possible commensurate transitions between like-spin electron states, which are in excellent agreement with the experimental nonmagnetic defect center emission.

However, quantum routing with photons, and its inverse, quantum decoupling, are difficult to implement as photons do not interact, or interact very weakly in nonlinear media. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of implementing photonic quantum routing based on effects in cavity quantum electrodynamics, and present a scheme for single-photon quantum routing controlled by the other photon using a hybrid system consisting of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled with a whispering-gallery-mode resonator-waveguide structure. Different from the cases in which classical information is used to control the path of quantum signals, both the control and signal photons are quantum in our implementation. Compared with the probabilistic quantum routing protocols based on linear optics, our scheme is deterministic and also scalable to multiple photons. We also present a scheme for single-photon quantum decoupling from an initial state with polarization and spatial-mode encoding, which can implement an inverse operation to the quantum routing. We discuss the feasibility of our schemes by considering current or near-future techniques, and show that both the schemes can operate effectively in the bad-cavity regime.

The methods of both the electrical parameter and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) are used to diagnose the electrical and optical parameters of the self-designed DBD cell under various discharge conditions. Meanwhile, the energy efficiency ratios (EERs) of quantum yield of active species in DBD is examined by OES. We deduce a series of formulas to calculate the consumed energy of the reactor by Lissajous figures. Using these formulas, the energy of an applied cycle and the energy consumed in a certain period of time can be obtained. The EERs of quantum yield and the conversion efficiency are not a liner trend with the change of applied voltage and energy.

Even with ever enlarging networks and data scale? Event detection and evaluation in social networks provide an effective solution, which has become the critical basis for many real applications, such as crisis management and decision making. The existing event detection methods mainly focus on text analysis that is limited in social media content and graphic feature statistic that needs calculate vast variables. Can we find an efficient way for generalized social networks with limited topology information? In this paper, a novel hybrid quantum swarm intelligence indexing method (HQSII) from the perspective of link prediction is proposed for the first time, which includes an optimal weight algorithm (OWA) and a fluctuation detection algorithm (FDA). The innovations behind HQSII lie in three aspects: (1) The mixed index that can universally describe the social network evolutions is proposed firstly, which explores the cooperation of different independent similarity indexes. OWA is further proposed to determine the optimal mixed index that achieves higher link prediction accuracy and better network evolution description than other independent and mixed similarity indexes. (2) To better avoid the interferences of routine network evolution fluctuations, the otherness of micro node evolutions is considered into link prediction. FDA is further proposed to quantify the abnormal fluctuations caused by events. (3) Based on OWA and FDA, HQSII is proposed for all the generalized social networks, which detects events by discovering abnormal fluctuations and evaluates events by analyzing fluctuation trends. Extensive experiments on theoretical and real-world social networks show that HQSII can accurately detect events and quantitatively evaluate event impacts in social networks with single and multiple events. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,10.1007/s11280-016-0416-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988418351&doi=10.1007%2fs11280-016-0416-y&partnerID=40&md5=faccfefca27754330ed19f2e192e1064,Article

As the QE response has to be characterized without the use of phenomenological damping parameters, the divergent nature of the pointlike emitter's in-phase self-field has to be carefully dealt with to avoid unphysical frequency shifts. Here we provide a solution to this problem and show two ways to obtain accurate results in the weak excitation limit using finite-difference time-domain algorithms. One of these approaches lays important groundwork needed for future simulations of nonlinear QE networks. The solution for dealing with the frequency shift reveals that dynamical contributions to the resonant depolarization field of arbitrarily small dielectric objects make crucial contributions to the net dipole moment induced by an external field when radiative scattering is the only source of damping. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.95.063853,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026838422&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.95.063853&partnerID=40&md5=5d7f542f63fa7742ce6b944ab6c934d3,Article

However, due to their turbulent nature, it is crucial to understand the impact of the atmosphere on the quantum properties of light and examine it experimentally. In this paper, we introduce a method to probe atmospheric free-space links with quantum light on a laboratory scale. In contrast to previous works, our method models arbitrary intensity losses caused by turbulence to emulate general atmospheric conditions. This allows us to characterize turbulent quantum channels in a well-controlled manner. To implement this technique, we perform a series of measurements with different constant attenuations and simulate the fluctuating losses by combining the obtained data. We directly test the proposed method with an on-chip source of nonclassical light and a time-bin-multiplexed detection system. With the obtained data, we characterize the nonclassicality of the generated states for different atmospheric noise models and analyze a postselection protocol. This general technique in atmospheric quantum optics allows for studying turbulent quantum channels and predicting their properties for future applications. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.95.063801,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026798113&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.95.063801&partnerID=40&md5=1e524457c307cc916863893e8ab2d549,Article

In this paper, we will describe an entanglement concentration protocol (ECP) for electronic C-GHZ state, by exploiting the electronic polarization beam splitters (PBSs) and charge detection. This protocol has several advantages. First, the parties do not need to know the exact coefficients of the initial less-entangled C-GHZ state, which makes this protocol feasible. Second, with the help of charge detection, the distilled maximally entangled C-GHZ state can be remained for future application. Third, this protocol can be repeated to obtain a higher success probability.

Photons emitted from conventional Stranski-Krastanov InGaAs quantum dots have shown non-optimal levels of entanglement and indistinguishability. For quantum networks, both criteria must be met simultaneously. Here, we show that this is possible with a system that has received limited attention so far: GaAs quantum dots. They can emit triggered polarization-entangled photons with high purity (g (2) (0) = 0.002±0.002), high indistinguishability (0.93±0.07 for 2 ns pulse separation) and high entanglement fidelity (0.94±0.01).

Although this one-way EPR steering phenomenon has been experimentally observed, the schemes to manipulate the direction of EPR steering have not been investigated thoroughly. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate three schemes to manipulate the direction of EPR steering, either by varying the noise on one party of a two-mode squeezed state (TMSS) or transmitting the TMSS in a noisy channel. The dependence of the direction of EPR steering on the noise and transmission efficiency in the quantum channel is analyzed.

In this paper, we present a scheme for generating larger entangled coherent W or GHZ state in an optical system by virtue of fusion technology. The key fusion mechanism is realized by photon detectors and a Mach–Zehnder interferometer with its two arms immersed in Kerr media, by which an n-mode entangled coherent W state and an m-mode entangled coherent W state can be probabilistically fused into an (n+ m- 2)-mode entangled coherent W state.

The problem of detecting EPR steering plays an important role in characterization of quantum nonlocality.

Resorting to an EPR steering inequality, one is required to apply a strategy as efficiently as possible for any selected measurement settings on the two subsystems, one of which may not be trusted. Inspired by the recent powerful linear criteria proposed by Saunders et al. [D. J. Saunders, S. J. Jones, H. M. Wiseman, and G. J. Pryde, Nat.

This occurs because we are inferring two pieces of information from one equation and measurement, NEE. While there are multiple methods for partitioning NEE, each has unique limitations that are difficult to evaluate as these techniques are often not implemented simultaneously. Here we present an analysis of multiple partitioning methods (a non-linear regression model known as the Reichstein method, artificial neural networks (ANN), stable carbon isotopes, and soil respiration (Rsoil) measurements) under ideal field conditions. We measured ecosystem-scale fluxes of stable C isotopes via a new quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectrometer and paired those measurements with a biophysical model CANVEG in order to close a system of equations and solve for gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). Isotope-partitioned GPP and Reco were on average 10–13% lower than Reichstein- and ANN-partitioned GPP and Reco. These results suggest that the Reichstein and ANN approaches, which use nighttime NEE to infer daytime Reco, may be overestimating Reco and GPP during the day. This may be attributed to higher plant respiration rates at night compared to the day, otherwise known as the Kok effect. As isotope measurements and theory become more accessible to diverse ecosystems it will grow to be more than a benchmarking technique and into a valuable means of improving understanding of carbon cycling. Future studies are encouraged to evaluate these techniques in increasingly complex ecosystems to determine when significant differences appear between partitioning methods and how those differences influence modeling of terrestrial carbon budgets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.12.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008500341&doi=10.1016%2fj.agrformet.2016.12.016&partnerID=40&md5=4735cf81de41bcd95e26d03b4cf9d3c5,Article

(2017),2017,TiO2 Nanoparticles Incorporated Peptide Appended Perylene Bisimide-Based Nanohybrid System: Enhancement of Photo-Switching Behavior,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,"A peptide appended perylene bisimide (PBI)-based new hydrogel has been discovered in phosphate buffer medium having the pH ranging from 7.00 to 9.00. This peptide appended PBI-derivative shows interesting photoswitching property in the aggregated state. This gel is thoroughly characterized by UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and rheological studies. TiO2 nanoparticles are also prepared by using a protein amino acid, glutamic acid, in water medium. The as-synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit usual photoswitching behavior. An organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterial is prepared by incorporating the as-synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles into the fibrillar gel network of the native gel. This TiO2-PBI-based hybrid soft material shows a characteristic of nanofiber and nanoparticle combination in their nanoscale coassembled state as it is evident from the respective TEM images of the hybrid material. Interestingly, this nanohybrid shows improved photoswitching properties (photocurrent gain) compared to that of its individual constituents (TiO2 nanoparticles and PBI-based xerogel). The increase in photoswitching property holds a future promise for making a new organic-inorganic hybrid material for the optoelectronic device application with a high photocurrent conversion efficiency.

Most of the progress in this category have been on the convergence conditions and optimizing the convergence rate of the algorithm, for quantum networks with undirected underlying topology. This paper aims to address the extension of this problem over quantum networks with directed underlying graphs. In doing so, the convergence to two different stable states namely, consensus and synchronous states have been studied. Based on the intertwining relation between the eigenvalues, it is shown that for determining the convergence rate to the consensus state, all induced graphs should be considered while for the synchronous state only the underlying graph suffices. Furthermore, it is illustrated that for the range of weights that the Aldouss conjecture holds true, the convergence rate to both states are equal.

To transfer quantum states using ensembles, rephasing techniques are used to mitigate fast decoherence resulting from inhomogeneous broadening, but these techniques generally limit the bandwidth, efficiency and active times of the quantum interface. Here, we use a dense ensemble of neodymium rare-earth ions strongly coupled to a nanophotonic resonator to demonstrate a significant cavity protection effect at the single-photon level-a technique to suppress ensemble decoherence due to inhomogeneous broadening. The protected Rabi oscillations between the cavity field and the atomic super-radiant state enable ultra-fast transfer of photonic frequency qubits to the ions (∼50 GHz bandwidth) followed by retrieval with 98.7% fidelity.

(2017),2017,Embedded Ag quantum dots into interconnected Co3O4 nanosheets grown on 3D graphene networks for high stable and flexible supercapacitors,Electrochimica Acta,"High stable, flexible and interconnected Co3O4 nanosheets with embedded Ag quantum dots (AgQDs) were uniformly grown on three dimensional graphene (3DG) networks and served as supercapacitor electrode to enhance the pseudocapacitance performance. The AgQDs were used to facilitate the growth of the Co3O4 nanosheets and improve the electrical conductivity of the hybrid electrode by forming a good ohmic contact and provide direct and stable pathways for rapid electron transport. The AgQDs contribute to produce an improved areal capacitance of 421 mF cm−2 (1052.5 F g−1) and 53.3 mF cm−2 for the Ag/Co3O4/3DG hybrid, for both the three- and the two-electrode configuration, respectively. These values are about three times higher compared to a pristine Co3O4/3DG electrode. The capacitance retention of ∼120% after 104 cycles shows that a Ag/Co3O4/3DG hybrid can provide a long and stable cycle performance with a high specific capacitance. This study provides an effective strategy to improve the performance of electrode materials for supercapacitors with a high efficiency and long life, which makes them promising candidates for future energy-storage applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.073,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006256415&doi=10.1016%2fj.electacta.2016.12.073&partnerID=40&md5=003c9a3678294dcf17a09b03cfe9d09e,Article

Wavelength-division multiplexing between QKD and classical optical communications by sharing the existing fiber-optics infrastructure is highly desired in order to reduce the cost of QKD applications. However, comparing to the light for classical transmission, quantum signals are very weak and easily affected by impairments from classical light, such as the spontaneous Raman-scattering effect. Here, by selecting an optimal wavelength of quantum signals, we significantly reduce the influence of the Raman-scattering effect. In addition, through coherent optical communication technology, we achieve high-speed classical data transmission with relatively low launch powers, thereby further reducing the impairments from classical light. As a result, we realize the multiplexing and long-distance copropagation of QKD and terabit classical data transmission up to 80 km. The data capacity is two orders of magnitude larger than the existing results. Our demonstration verifies the feasibility of QKD and classical communication to share the resources of backbone fiber links and thus taking the utility of QKD a great step forward. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.95.012301,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009982232&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.95.012301&partnerID=40&md5=a4ee41d3d9949186378dcae39311b59f,Article

The book provides a simple yet holistic view on the theoretical and application-oriented aspects of light, with a special focus on the underlying nonlinear phenomena. Exploring the very frontiers of light-wave technology, the text covers the basics of nonlinear fiberoptics and the dynamics of electromagnetic pulse propagation in nonlinear waveguides. It also highlights some of the latest advances in nonlinear optical fiber technology, discussing hidden symmetry reductions and Ablowitz–Kaup–Newell–Segur (AKNS) hierarchies for nonautonomous solitons, state-of-the-art Brillouin scattering applications, backpropagation, and the concept of eigenvalue communication—a powerful nonlinear digital signal processing technique that paves the way to overcome the current limitations of traditional communications methods in nonlinear fiber channels. Key chapters study the feasibility of the eigenvalue demodulation scheme based on digital coherent technology by throwing light on the experimental study of the noise tolerance of the demodulated eigenvalues, investigate matter wave solitons and other localized excitations pertaining to Bose–Einstein condensates in atom optics, and examine quantum field theory analogue effects occurring in binary waveguide arrays, plasmonic arrays, etc., as well as their ensuing nonlinear wave propagation. Featuring a foreword by Dr. Akira Hasegawa, the father of soliton communication systems, Odyssey of Light in Nonlinear Optical Fibers: Theory and Applications serves as a curtain raiser to usher in the photonics era.

Though scientists investigated the reduced graphene oxide in 1962, the key advance in graphene synthesis and study was explored in 2004 by scientists at Manchester University peeling a single layer of graphene using adhesive tape and a pencil, which is often referred to as a scotchtape or drawing method. In 2005, they collaborated with another group from Columbia University and found that the quasiparticles in graphene were massless Dirac fermions. Later more important unusual properties of graphene have been unveiled such as the quantum Hall effect, the bipolar-transistor effect, the ballistic transport of charges, large quantum oscillations, etc., which led to the immediate boost of further researches and applications based on graphene. Today graphene is attracting increasing attention from the physical, chemical, and biomedical fields as a novel nanomaterial with many exceptional features including unparalleled thermal conductivity (5000 W/m/K), excellent electrical conductivity (1738 S/m), high surface-to-volume ratio (2630 m2/g), remarkable mechanical strength (about 1100 GPa), and biocompatibility. Recently, graphene and functionalized graphene have been successfully used in many biomedical and bioassay applications and show promising potentials in these fields. These applications utilized the advantages of graphene in electrical and optical properties to construct a variety of graphene-based biosensors including electrochemical biosensors, field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors, optical biosensors, etc. Compared to carbon nanotubes, graphene lacks some bandgapinduced optical properties, but its chemical versatility and tunability nature, fluorescence, effective quencher, Raman, and NIR activity make it favorable, for fabricating optical biosensors. Recently, graphene-based optical nanobiosensors have been constructed to detect DNA/RNA, proteins, small molecules, and ions using different signal platforms, including fluorescence, colorimetry, SPR, SERS, etc. This chapter focuses on the recent progress in graphene-based optical biosensors and discusses the design, fabrication, and application of these optical nanobiosensors.

Although there have reports on this aspect [1, 2], a more extended discussion on each method has been not available, due to the space limitation in most cases. As stated earlier, graphene has attracted much attention, due to its unique structure, together with various extraordinary chemical and physical characteristics [3-5], thus leading to a wide range of potential applications in various fi elds [5, 6]. Due to its zero-gap semi-metal properties, pure graphene cannot be used to develop devices similar to those based on normal semiconductors [7-9]. This is the driving force to develop well-defi ned structures, including nanoribbons [10-12] and quantum dots [13, 14]. More specifi cally, graphene-based materials, which are used in energy, environment and biological applications, require 3D structures [15-18]. The 3D structured graphene materials could have high specifi c surface areas, strong mechanical properties and rapid mass and charge transport kinetics, due to the synergistic effect of the 3D porous structures and the intrinsic high conductivity of graphene. 3D graphene structures have also various other names, such as networks, foams, sponges, hydrogels and aerogels, which will not be specifi cally emphasized in this chapter and just follow the original references. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1201/9781315370606,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052589629&doi=10.1201%2f9781315370606&partnerID=40&md5=c47f6ee617817c62dd729f9cac22f82f,Book Chapter

(2017),2017,Noise of solid-state lasers,Solid-State Lasers and Applications,"Laser noise has been of high interest for many years, both in the context of fundamental physics and for a variety of laser applications. Simple types of lasers, particularly single-frequency lasers, constitute cases of strong interest in quantum optics which have been studied in great detail. The obtained understanding has also brought signiﬁcant beneﬁts for the further development of lasers with favorable noise properties, as required for many applications. For example, lasers are nowadays used in ﬁber-optic communication systems the data rates of which are fundamentally limited by noise issues. An important part of the noise in such a system comes from the laser source in the transmitter, another one usually from ﬁber ampliﬁers, where similar effects occur. Noise is similarly important for various kinds of metrology applications, including ultraprecise interferometric length measurements (e.g., for gravitational wave detection), spectroscopic measurements, and optical clocks surpassing cesium clocks in performance, to name only a few examples. Over quite a few decades, such types of applications have continued to act as a driver for the development of laser sources with still better noise properties, and of improved measurement techniques to monitor the success of such attempts. A decent understanding of how laser noise is generated does not only help to improve the performance of particular devices but also to realize fundamental limitations in order to correctly judge the future potential of different types of lasers for low-noise performance. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1201/9781420005295,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051776931&doi=10.1201%2f9781420005295&partnerID=40&md5=3abb221068eb4cf30eeb8451b821abc1,Book Chapter

Future space missions for gravity mapping, tests of the equivalence principle or the detection of gravitational waves require complex but robust and compact laser technologies. A promising approach to meet the stringent requirements, also with respect to optimised size, weight and power (SWaP) budgets, are laser systems based on a micro-integrated diode laser technology platform developed at the Ferdinand-Braun-Institut in a joint lab activity with Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. This platform provides compact, robust and energy-efficient semiconductor laser modules for various applications and environments, e.g. they operate in several cold atom experiments at the Bremen drop tower. Moreover, laser payloads for operation on sounding rockets have been developed and reached technology readiness level (TRL) 9 on such sub-orbital vehicles through flight qualification and successful mission operation. With these results, this laser technology is ready for first in-orbit tests on satellites. Due to the vast increase in performance and comparatively low mission costs, nano- and microsatellites have recently gained more and more attention in and outside the space community. The technological advancement this satellite class has seen over the past decade is mainly attributed to the use of components and development approaches from the automotive and the information and communications technology (ICT) industry. Besides cost and performance, here, especially the possibility to realise extremely short mission development times makes this satellite class predestined for demonstrating science and enabling technologies in space. Technische Universität Berlin has a long tradition of conducting successful small satellite missions. To date, twelve satellites have been launched and nine additional spacecraft are at various stages of their completion. Recently, Technische Universität Berlin developed TUBiX20, a modular satellite platform suitable for a broad variety of missions. Due to its modular architecture, this platform is well suited to support small science missions as key performance parameters can be adapted to comply with the payload's requirements. This paper examines the use of a TUBiX20 based satellite for the demonstration of optical quantum technology in space. We will discuss a scenario to study laser systems and related technologies in orbit, specifically regarding long-term performance, radiation effects, and autonomy. The realisation of such a mission would complement existing drop tower and sounding rocket heritage and, more importantly, close the gap towards higher maturity of laser system technology for future long-term missions on larger satellites. © 2017 by the International Astronautical Federation.

These satellites must be capable of delivering the traditional benefits of GEO i.e. reach or wide coverage with a lower cost per bit than the emerging constellations. Many solutions resolve around active arrays based on GaN SSPA with high capacity digital beam-formers. To enable this vision the cost, mass, and DC power per digitally processed bit must take a quantum step forward compared with historical solutions deployed in L band mobile missions. It is likely that this can only be achieved by taking benefit of the rapid progress of the terrestrial semi-conductor market where 10nm technology is now allowing mobile phones to deliver laptop beating processing power.

In the last decades, there have been many attempts to optimize the performance of optoelectronic devices by using innovative nanostructured semiconductor gain materials [1, 2]. A lot of these innovative devices already have found their way into photonic applications [3, 4]. In particular, the demand for faster and more energy-efficient data transfer set the trend to replace the well-established cable-based data transmission with energy efficient optical technologies [5]. As one example, optical amplifiers are needed in optical networks to raise the signal power level and compensate for the inevitable optical losses in glass-fiber connections. Semiconductor-based optical amplifiers (SOAs) are cheap, relatively easy to fabricate, and consume only little energy within an electric circuit.

It should be noted, that USP fiber lasers can be treated as an ideal platform to expand future applications due to the complex ML nonlinear dynamics in a laser resonator. Up to now a series of novel ML regimes have been investigated e.g. self-similar pulses, noise-like pulses, multi-bound solitons and soliton rain generation. Recently, we have used a highly nonlinear germanosilicate fiber (with germanium oxides concentration in the core ∼ 50 mol. %) inside the resonator for more reliable and robust launching of passive mode-locking based on the nonlinear polarization evolution effect in fibers. In this work we have measured promising and stable ML regimes such as stretched pulses, soliton rain and multi-bound solitons formed in a highly-nonlinear ring laser and obtained by intracavity group velocity dispersion (GVD) variation in slightly negative region. As a result, we have obtained the low noise ultrashort pulse generation with duration < 250 fs (more than 20 bound pulses when obtained multi-bound soliton generation with intertemporal width ∼ 5 ps) at a repetition rate ∼ 11.3 MHz (with signal-to-noise ratio at fundamental frequency > 59 dB) and relative intensity noise <-101 dBc / Hz. © 2017 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2291636,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039169376&doi=10.1117%2f12.2291636&partnerID=40&md5=7d3103ef4d16864a4849a0a01968866c,Conference Paper

If a high percentage of the optical pulses are comprised of single photons, then the statistical nature of light and information theory can be used to generate secure shared random bit strings which can then be converted to keys for encryption systems. When these keys are incorporated along with symmetric encryption techniques such as a one-Time pad, then this method of key generation and encryption is resistant to future advances in quantum computing which will significantly degrade the effectiveness of current asymmetric key sharing techniques. This research first reviews the transition of Quantum Key Distribution free-space experiments from the laboratory environment to field experiments, and finally, ongoing space experiments. Next, a propagation model for an optical pulse from low-earth orbit to ground and the effects of turbulence on the transmitted optical pulse is described. An Adaptive Optics system is modeled to correct for the aberrations caused by the atmosphere. The long-Term point spread function of the completed low-earth orbit to ground optical system is explored in the results section.

(2017),2017,Approaches to a global quantum key distribution network,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Progress in realising quantum computers threatens to weaken existing public key encryption infrastructure. A global quantum key distribution (QKD) network can play a role in computational attack-resistant encryption. Such a network could use a constellation of high altitude platforms such as airships and satellites as trusted nodes to facilitate QKD between any two points on the globe on demand. This requires both space-To-ground and inter-platform links. However, the prohibitive cost of traditional satellite based development limits the experimental work demonstrating relevant technologies. To accelerate progress towards a global network, we use an emerging class of shoe-box sized spacecraft known as CubeSats. We have designed a polarization entangled photon pair source that can operate on board CubeSats. The robustness and miniature form factor of our entanglement source makes it especially suitable for performing pathfinder missions that studies QKD between two high altitude platforms. The technological outcomes of such mission would be the essential building blocks for a global QKD network. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

(2017),2017,Transition metal redox switches for reversible on/off and slow/fast single-molecule magnet behaviour in dysprosium and erbium bis-diamidoferrocene complexes,Chemical Science,"Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are considered viable candidates for next-generation data storage and quantum computing. Systems featuring switchability of their magnetization dynamics are particularly interesting with respect to accessing more complex logic gates and device architectures. Here we show that transition metal based redox events can be exploited to enable reversible switchability of slow magnetic relaxation of magnetically anisotropic lanthanide ions. Specifically, we report anionic homoleptic bis-diamidoferrocene complexes of Dy3+ (oblate) and Er3+ (prolate) which can be reversibly oxidized by one electron to yield their respective charge neutral redox partners (Dy: [1]-, 1; Er: [2]-, 2). Importantly, compounds 1 and 2 are thermally stable which allowed for detailed studies of their magnetization dynamics. We show that the Dy3+[1]-/1 system can function as an ""on""/""off"" or a ""slow""/""fast"" redox switchable SMM system in the absence or presence of applied dc fields, respectively. The Er3+ based [2]-/2 system features ""on""/""off"" switchability of SMM properties in the presence of applied fields. Results from electrochemical investigations, UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy indicate the presence of significant electronic communication between the mixed-valent Fe ions in 1 and 2 in both solution and solid state.

These protocols typically combine physical properties of the communication channel with cryptographic challenge-response schemes. A key challenge to design secure DB protocols is to keep the time required by the prover to process the challenges and compute and transmit the responses as low as possible. For this purpose, different implementation approaches have been proposed in the literature, both in the analog as in the digital domain. Moreover, different types of communication channels have been proposed as well to find an optimal balance between security and implementation feasibility. This paper is the first to evaluate the feasibility of implementing DB protocols using quantum communication. Unlike conventional DB protocols, which execute the rapid-bit exchanges over a Radio Frequency (RF) or ultrasound channel, our quantum-based DB protocol makes use of quantum-bit (qubit) transmissions and detection during the challenge-response phase. Our protocol offers security against distance fraud, mafia fraud and terrorist attacks.

The intermittency and uncertainty of wind power may pose danger on the safety of the power system, thus Research of short-term load forecasting has important practical application value in the field of power network dispatching. The keys of wind power forecasting are the forecasting model selection and model optimization. In this paper, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is chosen as the wind speed and the wind power prediction model and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to optimize the most important parameters which influence the least squares support vector machine regression model. In the proposed QPSO-LSSVM, the kernel parameter σ and regularization parameter γ are considered as the position vector of particles and quantum mechanics is introduced in particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to effectively solve the contradiction between expanding search and finding optimal solution. A multiinput-multi-output (MIMO) short-term prediction model is built and applied in a wind farm of Gansu province in order to predict wind speed and wind power. For comparative study, PSO-LSSVM model and SVM model are used for forecasting, meanwhile, several error indicators are selected to analyze the results of the three models. Prediction analysis results show that the QPSO-LSSVM model can achieve higher prediction accuracy and confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.

From the view of the stereographic projection, we can naturally introduce the wave property originating from the singular point at the “North pole” on the circumference S1 coordinate corresponding to a critical point for the collisional decoherence (condition 1). This picture also predicts the sudden changes of wave-phase collapse due to network interaction in the many-body system (condition 2). Thus it is hoped that the model proposed by Ureña et al. based on the dipole-induced dipole interaction in the NO + Ar system could be modified through this picture by including interactions with many Ar atoms in the environment. One way to fill the gap between the single-pair interaction picture and the multiple interaction one would be to employ theoretical calculations by use of the density matrix theory with and without adding the second Ar atom to the NO–Ar system. The cusp catastrophe theory reinforces the necessity of some cooperative network interaction between the coherent NO molecule and many neighboring Ar atoms and provides a qualitative scenario in which the whole system leads to a sudden change of the collisional decoherence of NO as a function of the control parameters (a, b). At this stage, the present physico-mathematical picture cannot give any specific values of the decoherence distance by the theory itself, but it clearly provides us a new topological concept for clarifying the origin of collisional decoherence which is strongly connected with the complexity of the system. Thus it gives us a global guide map toward further clarification of the collisional decoherence phenomenon with the aid of more sophisticated quantum mechanical calculations in the future. © 2016 The Chemical Society Located in Taipei & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This mobilization can be dangerous for the safety of the operators working in the factory and for the safety of the factory itself. It is therefore necessary to develop predictive models to simulate and forecast dust mobilization. The Quantum Electronics and Plasma Physics (QEP) Research Group of the University of Rome Tor Vergata has developed a facility to experimentally replicate dust mobilization in different critical conditions in an enclosed environment. The measurements performed with diagnostics available in the facility, provide the boundary conditions to run numerical simulations and to validate mobilization models. Even if the initial field of application of this novel facility is dust mobilization is nuclear fusion, the methodology developed can be used for the medicine industry, for the agribusiness and others.

1586,Scopus,D’Ariano (2017),2017,Physics Without Physics: The Power of Information-theoretical Principles,International Journal of Theoretical Physics,"David Finkelstein was very fond of the new information-theoretic paradigm of physics advocated by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman. Only recently, however, the paradigm has concretely shown its full power, with the derivation of quantum theory (Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. A 84:012311, 2011; D’Ariano et al., 2017) and of free quantum field theory (D’Ariano and Perinotti, Phys. Rev. A 90:062106, 2014; Bisio et al., Phys. Rev. A 88:032301, 2013; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 354:244, 2015; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 368:177, 2016) from informational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the possibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical theory, allowing a re-foundation of the whole physics over logically solid grounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new information-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly interesting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with the idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information processing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the holographic principle (Susskind, J. Math. Phys. 36:6377, 1995; Bousso, Rev. Mod. Phys. 74:825, 2002). In this paper I review how free quantum field theory is derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special relativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is simply provided by the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum systems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple principles: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature of the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory in terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic argument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the currently observed regime where discreteness is not visible is the so-called “relativistic regime” of small wavevectors, which holds for all energies ever tested (and even much larger), where the usual free quantum field theory is perfectly recovered. In the present quantum discrete theory Einstein relativity principle can be restated without using space-time in terms of invariance of the eigenvalue equation of the automaton/walk under change of representations. Distortions of the Poincaré group emerge at the Planck scale, whereas special relativity is perfectly recovered in the relativistic regime. Discreteness, on the other hand, has some plus compared to the continuum theory: 1) it contains it as a special regime; 2) it leads to some additional features with GR flavor: the existence of an upper bound for the particle mass (with physical interpretation as the Planck mass), and a global De Sitter invariance; 3) it provides its own physical standards for space, time, and mass within a purely mathematical adimensional context.

This is a relevant problem to those people who use their voices professionally, and its early identification can help determine a suitable treatment to avoid its progress or even to eliminate the problem. This work focuses on the development of a new model for the identification of aging voices (independently of their chronological age), using as input attributes parameters extracted from the voice and glottal signals. The proposed model, named Quantum binary-real evolving Spiking Neural Network (QbrSNN), is based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), with an unsupervised training algorithm, and a Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm that automatically determines the most relevant attributes and the optimal parameters that configure the SNN. The QbrSNN model was evaluated in a database composed of 120 records, containing samples from three groups of speakers.

After revisiting the governing dispersion relation and properties of the supported surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), we discuss the different topologies that uniaxial MTSs can implement. Particular attention is devoted to the hyperbolic regime, which exhibits unusual features, such as an ideally infinite wave confinement and local density of states. In this context, we clarify the different physical mechanisms that limit the practical implementation of these ideal concepts using materials found in nature, and we describe several approaches to realize hyperbolic MTSs, ranging from the use of novel 2D materials such as black phosphorus to artificial nanostructured composites made of graphene or silver. Some exciting phenomena and applications are then presented and discussed, including negative refraction and the routing of SPPs within the surface, planar hyperlensing, dramatic enhancement and tailoring of the local density of states, and broadband super-Planckian thermal emission.

1589,Scopus,Chipperfield et al. (2016),2016,Model sensitivity studies of the decrease in atmospheric carbon tetrachloride,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,"Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is an ozone-depleting substance, which is controlled by the Montreal Protocol and for which the atmospheric abundance is decreasing. However, the current observed rate of this decrease is known to be slower than expected based on reported CCl4 emissions and its estimated overall atmospheric lifetime. Here we use a three-dimensional (3-D) chemical transport model to investigate the impact on its predicted decay of uncertainties in the rates at which CCl4 is removed from the atmosphere by photolysis, by ocean uptake and by degradation in soils. The largest sink is atmospheric photolysis (74 % of total), but a reported 10 % uncertainty in its combined photolysis cross section and quantum yield has only a modest impact on the modelled rate of CCl4 decay. This is partly due to the limiting effect of the rate of transport of CCl4 from the main tropospheric reservoir to the stratosphere, where photolytic loss occurs. The model suggests large interannual variability in the magnitude of this stratospheric photolysis sink caused by variations in transport. The impact of uncertainty in the minor soil sink (9 % of total) is also relatively small. In contrast, the model shows that uncertainty in ocean loss (17 % of total) has the largest impact on modelled CCl4 decay due to its sizeable contribution to CCl4 loss and large lifetime uncertainty range (147 to 241 years). With an assumed CCl4 emission rate of 39 Gg yearg-1, the reference simulation with the best estimate of loss processes still underestimates the observed CCl4 (overestimates the decay) over the past 2 decades but to a smaller extent than previous studies. Changes to the rate of CCl4 loss processes, in line with known uncertainties, could bring the model into agreement with in situ surface and remote-sensing measurements, as could an increase in emissions to around 47 Gg yearg-1. Further progress in constraining the CCl4 budget is partly limited by systematic biases between observational datasets. For example, surface observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) network are larger than from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network but have shown a steeper decreasing trend over the past 2 decades. These differences imply a difference in emissions which is significant relative to uncertainties in the magnitudes of the CCl4 sinks. © Author(s) 2016.",,10.5194/acp-16-15741-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006975020&doi=10.5194%2facp-16-15741-2016&partnerID=40&md5=33343fe8f4f07aeda96260acfed51db2,Article

One topic which remains open for investigation and optimization relates to the design of the classical-quantum interface, where control operations on individual qubits are applied according to higher-level algorithms; accommodating competing demands on performance and scalability remains a major outstanding challenge. In this work, we present a resource-efficient, scalable framework for the implementation of embedded physical layer classical controllers for quantum-information systems. Design drivers and key functionalities are introduced, leading to the selection of Walsh functions as an effective functional basis for both programing and controller hardware implementation. This approach leverages the simplicity of real-time Walsh-function generation in classical digital hardware, and the fact that a wide variety of physical layer controls, such as dynamic error suppression, are known to fall within the Walsh family. We experimentally implement a real-time field-programmable-gate-array-based Walsh controller producing Walsh timing signals and Walsh-synthesized analog waveforms appropriate for critical tasks in error-resistant quantum control and noise characterization.

(2016),2016,Two-Component Fluorescent-Semiconducting Hydrogel from Naphthalene Diimide-Appended Peptide with Long-Chain Amines: Variation in Thermal and Mechanical Strengths of Gels,Langmuir,"Two-component fluorescent hydrogels have been discovered, containing the mixtures of naphthalene diimide (NDI)-conjugated peptide-functionalized bola-amphiphile and primary amines with long alkyl chains at physiological pH 7.46. The aggregation-induced enhanced emission associated with an NDI-appended peptide in aqueous medium is rare, as water is known to be a good quencher of fluorescence. In this study, an NDI-containing gelator peptide forms a highly fluorescent aggregate in aqueous medium. Absorption and emission spectroscopic techniques reveal the formation of J-aggregates among the chromophoric moieties in their aggregated state in aqueous medium. However, this NDI-containing peptide does not form any gel in aqueous medium. In the presence of the primary amines with long alkyl chains in the buffer solution, it forms two-component fluorescent hydrogels exhibiting bright yellow fluorescence under a UV lamp (365 nm). Probably, the acid-amine interaction between the amines and the bola-amphiphile triggers the gel formation, as evident from Fourier transform infrared data, indicating the presence of a carboxylate group (−COO-) and an ammonium species (NH3+) in the coassembled two-component gel system. Low- and wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering further support the fact that the coassembled state in the gel form is produced by the supramolecular interaction between the NDI-based bola-amphiphile and the long-chain amines. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images reveal that the π-conjugated coassembled hydrogels exhibit nanofibrillar network morphologies. Interestingly, the coassembled hydrogels exhibit an enhanced fluorescence emission, excited-state lifetime, and quantum yield when compared with those of the NDI-containing amphiphile alone in its self-assembled state in aqueous medium. Moreover, the thermal stability and mechanical strength of these gels have been successfully tuned by varying the alkyl chain length of the corresponding amine. Moreover, these NDI-peptide-conjugated soft materials exhibit semiconducting behavior in their respective coassembled states. This holds future promise to use these peptide-appended NDI-based coassembled soft materials for applications in optoelectronic and other devices. © 2016 American Chemical Society",,10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b02727,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006086194&doi=10.1021%2facs.langmuir.6b02727&partnerID=40&md5=a4962c168599598145554a8eb412713d,Article

(2016),2016,Ocean acidification affects marine chemical communication by changing structure and function of peptide signalling molecules,Global Change Biology,"Ocean acidification is a global challenge that faces marine organisms in the near future with a predicted rapid drop in pH of up to 0.4 units by the end of this century. Effects of the change in ocean carbon chemistry and pH on the development, growth and fitness of marine animals are well documented. Recent evidence also suggests that a range of chemically mediated behaviours and interactions in marine fish and invertebrates will be affected. Marine animals use chemical cues, for example, to detect predators, for settlement, homing and reproduction. But, while effects of high CO2 conditions on these behaviours are described across many species, little is known about the underlying mechanisms, particularly in invertebrates. Here, we investigate the direct influence of future oceanic pH conditions on the structure and function of three peptide signalling molecules with an interdisciplinary combination of methods. NMR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations were used to assess the direct molecular influence of pH on the peptide cues, and we tested the functionality of the cues in different pH conditions using behavioural bioassays with shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) as a model system. We found that peptide signalling cues are susceptible to protonation in future pH conditions, which will alter their overall charge. We also show that structure and electrostatic properties important for receptor binding differ significantly between the peptide forms present today and the protonated signalling peptides likely to be dominating in future oceans. The bioassays suggest an impaired functionality of the signalling peptides at low pH. Physiological changes due to high CO2 conditions were found to play a less significant role in influencing the investigated behaviour. From our results, we conclude that the change of charge, structure and consequently function of signalling molecules presents one possible mechanism to explain altered behaviour under future oceanic pH conditions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,10.1111/gcb.13354,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977570421&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13354&partnerID=40&md5=89dd188fa6d164da5a33c4895b8592f3,Article

Analogous with traditional cavity optomechanical system, the role of optical cavity is played by a localized exciton in carbon nanotube while the role of the mechanical element is played by the nanotube vibrations, which enables the realization of an opto-transistor based on carbon nanotube. Since the signal amplification and attenuation have been observed in traditional optomechanical system, and the nanotube optomechanical system has been realized in laboratory, the proposed carbon nanotube opto-transistor could be implemented in current experiments and open the door to potential applications in modern optical networks and future quantum networks. © 2016 The Author(s).",,10.1038/srep37193,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995544873&doi=10.1038%2fsrep37193&partnerID=40&md5=21dce4c0d501a5524b04098d83c5687b,Article

Since the proposal of the spin FET in 1990 by Datta and Das, semiconductor materials have been studied for their spin–orbit (S–O) interactions, particularly those that can be modified by an applied electric field, such as the Rashba S–O interaction, in order to create devices that utilise spin modulation and control to perform logic operations. Since then new proposals have appeared. Nowadays they include spin transistors with several different operating principles, spin-based diodes, spin-based field programmable gate arrays, dynamic spin-logic circuits, spin-only logic, spin communication and others. In this review, the focus will be made on presenting recent progress in Ge spintronics including the key advances made. The absence of Dresselhaus S–O coupling in Ge enables a longer spin diffusion length when compared to III–V semiconductor materials. Evidence of a strong Rashba S–O interaction in strained Ge quantum wells has begun to emerge. Also, the first experimental demonstration of room-temperature spin transport in Ge has recently been reported. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Then a pair of quadrature amplitude squeezed optical fields is prepared with two degenerate optical parameter amplifiers that are pumped by the resulting laser at 398 nm. Finally, the polarization squeezed state of light is generated by combining the above two quadrature amplitude squeezed optical beams on a polarizing beam splitter, and the quantum fluctuations of three Stokes operators simultaneously are reduced 4.0 dB below the quantum noise limit.

(2016),2016,A Direct Product Theorem for Two-Party Bounded-Round Public-Coin Communication Complexity,Algorithmica,"A strong direct product theorem for a problem in a given model of computation states that, in order to compute k instances of the problem, if we provide resource which is less than k times the resource required for computing one instance of the problem with constant success probability, then the probability of correctly computing all the k instances together, is exponentially small in k. In this paper, we consider the model of two-party bounded-round public-coin randomized communication complexity. We show a direct product theorem for the communication complexity of any complete relation in this model. In particular, our result implies a strong direct product theorem for the two-party constant-round public-coin randomized communication complexity of all complete relations. As an immediate application of our result, we get a strong direct product theorem for the pointer chasing problem. This problem has been well studied for understanding round v/s communication trade-offs in both classical and quantum communication protocols. Our result generalizes the result of Jain which can be regarded as the special case when the number of messages is one. Our result can be considered as an important progress towards settling the strong direct product conjecture for two-party public-coin communication complexity, a major open question in this area. We show our result using information theoretic arguments. Our arguments and techniques build on the ones used by Jain. One key tool used in our work and also by Jain is a message compression technique due to Braverman and Rao, who used it to show a direct sum theorem in the same model of communication complexity as considered by us. Another important tool that we use is a correlated sampling protocol which, for example, has been used by Holenstein for proving a parallel repetition theorem for two-prover games. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,10.1007/s00453-015-0100-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84950301349&doi=10.1007%2fs00453-015-0100-0&partnerID=40&md5=51090836b2d390c4e136f047330da0c7,Article

Dedicated devices are commonly required to implement QKD. In this paper, we propose a scheme which allows classical communication and QKD to be implemented simultaneously using the same communication infrastructure. More specially, we propose a coherent communication scheme where both the bits for classical communication and the Gaussian distributed random numbers for QKD are encoded on the same weak coherent pulse and decoded by the same coherent receiver. Simulation results based on practical system parameters show that both deterministic classical communication with a bit error rate of 10-9 and secure key distribution could be achieved over tens of kilometers of single-mode fibers. It is conceivable that in the future coherent optical communication network, QKD will be operated in the background of classical communication at a minimal cost. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.94.042340,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992690854&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.94.042340&partnerID=40&md5=3398d555d092f293dffed63d3740f507,Article

N-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) are one of the most promising nanomaterials due to abundant electrocatalytic edging and N doping active sites, but low yield, high dispersity and no forming efficient percolative conductive network hinder their direct application as the electrocatalyst. Hydrothermal method is an effective route for preparing high-quality N-GQDs and meanwhile, overcomes the drawbacks of complicated preparing progress and low yield. We further hydrothermally prepare the hybrid material of N-GQDs/Graphene (G) to immobilize N-GQDs on graphene and construct 3D conductive network. Therefore, the inexpensive N-GQDs/G integrates the advantages of rich edges, N doping active sites, high conductivity, and large specific surface area. As confirmed by a series of characterizations and tests, the N-GQDs/G performs high electocatalytic performance (dominating four-electron pathway), long-term stability and resistance to methanol crossover.

This method explicitly includes the nature of complicated solvent structures that is absent in implicit solvation methods. Because the ASEP/MD method treats only solvent molecule dynamics, it requires less computational cost than the conventional quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches. Herein, we present a real-space rectangular grid-based method to implement the mean-field QM/MM idea of ASEP/MD to plane-wave DFT, which is termed ""DFT in classical explicit solvents"", or DFT-CES. By employing a three-dimensional real-space grid as a communication medium, we can treat the electrostatic interactions between the DFT solute and the ASEP sampled from MD simulations in a seamless and straightforward manner. Moreover, we couple a fast and efficient free energy calculation method based on the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model with our DFT-CES method, which enables direct and simultaneous computation of the solvation free energies as well as the geometric and electronic responses of a solute of interest under the solvation effect. With the aid of DFT-CES/2PT, we investigate the solvation free energies and detailed solvation thermodynamics for 17 types of organic molecules, which show good agreement with the experimental data. We further compare our simulation results with previous theoretical models and assumptions made for the development of implicit solvation models. We anticipate that our proposed method, DFT-CES/2PT, will enable vast utilization of the ASEP/MD method for investigating solvation properties of materials by using periodic DFT calculations in the future. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00469,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991277905&doi=10.1021%2facs.jctc.6b00469&partnerID=40&md5=c686be5f2852860fcf18f3fe30559e4f,Article

Spintronics has infiltrated almost every household in the form of the read head sensors for the hard drives that inhabit every desktop and most laptop computers. Embedded magnetic random access memory (MRAM) and in-plane STT-RAM are rapidly replacing SRAM in a host of applications that do not require ultra-dense memories. Soon these embedded spintronic memories will permeate the cell phone market because they are much denser than SRAM, offer lower power at only slightly lower speed and are non-volatile. The present work in spintronics at most of the mainstream semiconductor companies and foundaries is focused on the development of perpendicular STT-MRAM, as a universal memory that can compete with the mainstream memories and surpass them in several key metrics. Several innovative ideas are presented where spintronics may have an impact because of the uniqueness of the approach. Nanomagnetic logic and storage may offer extremely high densities at very low power. Spin-torque oscillators are a very novel approach to pattern recognition that may be relevant for handling massive data sets.

By quantum chemistry calculation, the mechanism of ISQ's sharp absorption spectrum is analyzed.

Perfect security between mistrustful parties is unfortunately impossible to achieve through the asynchronous exchange of classical and quantum messages. Perfect security can nonetheless be achieved if each party splits into two agents exchanging classical information at times and locations satisfying strict relativistic constraints. A relativistic multiround protocol to achieve this was previously proposed and used to implement a 2-millisecond commitment time. Much longer durations were initially thought to be insecure, but recent theoretical progress showed that this is not so. In this Letter, we report on the implementation of a 24-hour bit commitment solely based on timed high-speed optical communication and fast data processing, with all agents located within the city of Geneva. This duration is more than 6 orders of magnitude longer than before, and we argue that it could be extended to one year and allow much more flexibility on the locations of the agents.

A case study from Quantum ESPRESSO,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Density Functional Theory calculations with plane waves and pseudopotentials represent one of the most important simulation techniques in high performance computing. Together with parallel linear algebra (ZGEMM and matrix diagonalization), the most important bottleneck results from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), required, for example, when the local potential is applied to the wavefunction. In these calculations, the existence of a cutoff on the plane waves is reflected on a spherical domain for the FFT. After a 1D FFT is performed on pencils distributed among processors, data is transposed with a MPI Alltoall and a 2D FFT is executed [2]. Typically, the workload of the FFT is not particularly high, since grid sizes do not exceed (103 102)3. However, the load distribution is crucial and the consequent impact of collective communications becomes a critical factor for achieving a high parallel efficiency. Quantum ESPRESSO [3] is one of the most used codes based on plane-wave DFT in the community of material science. It has been successfully ported and optimized on a large number of HPC infrastructures all over the world. The parallel structure of Quantum ESPRESSO is mainly based on several layers of MPI communicators, plus a finer grain OpenMP parallelization. Recently, the parallelization structure of the FFT was deeply refactored. The combination of two different data distributions, i.e. bands and taskgroups, allow the underlyinghardware to be hierarchically filled and two different layers of communications to be tuned. In particular, with sufficient memory, by tuning the number of taskgroups one can fit all the data required to perform a single 3D FFT reducing the impact of the MPI Alltoall between the 1D and 2D FFTs. In order to better check the results of the parametrization of the parallel distributions, a miniapp [1] containing only the FFT kernel was extracted from the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution. This miniapp is also important for the future activity of code design of novel architectures. We present and discuss the profiling data obtained from the QE-FFT miniapp and the impact on the communication pattern deriving from the choice of the parallelization parameters. © 2016 ACM.",,10.1145/2966884.2966892,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995550709&doi=10.1145%2f2966884.2966892&partnerID=40&md5=35815d61f64b8b699670c336ace16ebc,Conference Paper

We show that the modulation scheme of our protocol works equivalently to that of the Gaussian-modulated coherent-states (GMCS) protocol, but shows better experimental feasibility in the plug-and-play configuration. Besides, it waives the necessity of propagation of a local oscillator (LO) between legitimate users and generates a real local LO for quantum measurement. Our protocol is proposed independent of the one-way GMCS QKD without sending a LO [Opt. Lett. 40, 3695 (2015)10.1364/OL.40.003695; Phys. Rev. X 5, 041009 (2015)10.1103/PhysRevX.5.041009; Phys. Rev.

In those recent works, the system stability will suffer the impact of polarization drifts induced by environmental perturbations, and two independent frequency-locked laser sources are necessary to achieve reliable coherent detection. In the proposed protocol, these previous problems can be resolved. We derive the security bounds for our protocol against collective attacks, and we also perform a proof-of-principle experiment to confirm the utility of our proposal in real-life applications.

(2016),2016,Atomic scale plasmonic devices,International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks,"The arrival of the Single-Atom Transistor (SAT) in 2004, a quantum device operated at room temperature, allowed for the first controlled switching of an electrical current by the reproducible relocation of one single metal atom [1]. At the same time this component established the feasibility of transistors completely made of metals. Meanwhile, many experiments have followed, demonstrating the control of this three-terminal device on the atomic level and even showing a first simple integrated circuit [2]-[4]. A comparable device for plasmonic switching has not been realized yet. However, the fact that this Single Atom Transistor is made of silver - which is an ideal metal for plasmonics - opens intriguing perspectives for combining electronic and plasmonic switching in one and the same device at the atomic level. In this paper, we will demonstrate that photonic scaling is only limited by the atom. In particular we will present a novel plasmonic switch and photodetector featuring digital response at atomic scale.

1622,Scopus,Hacker et al. (2016),2016,A photon-photon quantum gate based on a single atom in an optical resonator,Nature,"That two photons pass each other undisturbed in free space is ideal for the faithful transmission of information, but prohibits an interaction between the photons. Such an interaction is, however, required for a plethora of applications in optical quantum information processing. The long-standing challenge here is to realize a deterministic photon-photon gate, that is, a mutually controlled logic operation on the quantum states of the photons. This requires an interaction so strong that each of the two photons can shift the other's phase by π radians. For polarization qubits, this amounts to the conditional flipping of one photon's polarization to an orthogonal state. So far, only probabilistic gates based on linear optics and photon detectors have been realized, because ""no known or foreseen material has an optical nonlinearity strong enough to implement this conditional phase shift"". Meanwhile, tremendous progress in the development of quantum-nonlinear systems has opened up new possibilities for single-photon experiments. Platforms range from Rydberg blockade in atomic ensembles to single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics. Applications such as single-photon switches and transistors, two-photon gateways, nondestructive photon detectors, photon routers and nonlinear phase shifters have been demonstrated, but none of them with the ideal information carriers: optical qubits in discriminable modes. Here we use the strong light-matter coupling provided by a single atom in a high-finesse optical resonator to realize the Duan-Kimble protocol of a universal controlled phase flip (π phase shift) photon-photon quantum gate. We achieve an average gate fidelity of (76.2 ± 3.6) per cent and specifically demonstrate the capability of conditional polarization flipping as well as entanglement generation between independent input photons. This photon-photon quantum gate is a universal quantum logic element, and therefore could perform most existing two-photon operations. The demonstrated feasibility of deterministic protocols for the optical processing of quantum information could lead to new applications in which photons are essential, especially long-distance quantum communication and scalable quantum computing. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The GTFock code is an HF implementation that, while it does not have all the features in NWChem, represents crucial algorithmic advances that reduce communication and improve load balance by doing an up-front static partitioning of tasks, followed by work stealing whenever necessary. To enable innovations in algorithms and exploit next generation exascale systems, it is crucial to support quantum chemistry codes using expressive and convenient programming models and runtime systems that are also efficient and scalable. This paper presents an HF implementation similar to GTFock using UPC++, a partitioned global address space model that includes flexible communication, asynchronous remote computation, and a powerful multidimensional array library. UPC++ offers runtime features that are useful for HF such as active messages, a rich calculus for array operations, hardware-supported fetch-and-add, and functions for ensuring asynchronous runtime progress. We present a new distributed array abstraction, DArray, that is convenient for the kinds of random-access array updates and linear algebra operations on block-distributed arrays with irregular data ownership. We analyze the performance of atomic fetch-and-add operations (relevant for load balancing) and runtime attentiveness, then compare various techniques and optimizations for each.

In this paper, the concept of indoor optical wireless power transfer to SCs is investigated in the absence of ambient light, i.e., during darkness hours. An experimental study is conducted by the use of up to four red laser diodes (LDs), a crystalline silicon solar panel and cell placed at 5.2 m. A value of 69% is measured for the fill factor of the solar panel. Also, a total power efficiency of 3.2% is measured for an optical wireless (OW) link with an average efficiency of two LDs of 26.8%, a solar cell efficiency of 13.3% and only 10.6% of geometrical losses. A comparison of this link with a state-of-the-art inductive power transfer system shows an improvement of the total power efficiency by 2.7 times. Another OW link is implemented with a divergence of full width at 36.8% of the peak intensity of 3 and 5.75 mrad along the small and large axes of the beam, respectively. The experimental levels of harvested power are in the order of mW, whereas approximately 1 W is required for the operation of a SC. Therefore, a 42 laser-based transmitter is designed both analytically and by the use of the simulation tool Zemax.

Describing the system within a tight-binding formalism we present an analytical method to unravel the analogy between a one-dimensional magnetic chain and a multi-strand ladder network. This analogy is crucial, and is subsequently exploited to engineer gaps in the energy spectrum by an appropriate choice of the magnetic substrate. We obtain an exact correlation between the magnitude of the spin of the incoming beam of particles and the magnetic moment of the substrate atoms in the chain desired for opening up of a spectral gap. Results of spin polarized transport, calculated within a transfer matrix formalism, are presented for particles having half-integer as well as higher spin states. We find that the chain can be made to act as a quantum device which opens a transmission window only for selected spin components over certain ranges of the Fermi energy, blocking them in the remaining part of the spectrum. The results appear to be robust even when the choice of the substrate atoms deviates substantially from the ideal situation, as verified by extending the ideas to the case of a 'spin spiral'. Interestingly, the spin spiral geometry, apart from exhibiting the filtering effect, is also seen to act as a device flipping spins - an effect that can be monitored by an interplay of the system size and the period of the spiral.

Examples include higher rates of key distribution and random number generation. The main disadvantage of using such multi-dimensional quantum systems is the increased complexity of the experimental setup. Here, we analyze a not-so-obvious problem: the relation between randomness certification and computational requirements of the post-processing of experimental data. In particular, we consider semi-device independent randomness certification from an experiment using a four dimensional quantum system to violate the classical bound of a random access code. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a smaller quantum violation requires more computational power to demonstrate randomness, which at some point becomes impossible with today's computers although the randomness is (probably) still there. We show that by dedicating more input settings of the experiment to randomness certification, then by more computational postprocessing of the experimental data which corresponds to a quantum violation, one may increase the amount of certified randomness. Furthermore, we introduce a method that significantly lowers the computational complexity of randomness certification. Our results show how more randomness can be generated without altering the hardware and indicate a path for future semi-device independent protocols to follow. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.",,10.1088/1367-2630/18/6/065004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976871061&doi=10.1088%2f1367-2630%2f18%2f6%2f065004&partnerID=40&md5=8e8422b775c5eb6c508199a955bf02a1,Article

The results were rather encouraging and indicated that the presented forecasting method has the potential to be utilized as an estimation tool for failure prediction in industrial machinery. © 2016, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,10.1007/s11518-016-5308-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84975515390&doi=10.1007%2fs11518-016-5308-2&partnerID=40&md5=3c19be84335854ea9856dd2e97756032,Article

The experimental results and theoretical calculations presented in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of Raman amplification in O-band access systems; thus, enhancing the performance of existing access installations while still preserving the passive nature of these networks. With the availability of cost-effective quantum dot laser diodes as high-power pumps, Raman amplification is proving to be an attractive candidate for access applications. We experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a total pump power of 759 mW using polarization multiplexed quantum dot laser diodes (QD-LDs), and using a backward pumping scheme we can support a purely passive XG-PON system with 50 km reach and 64 splits. With system level numerical simulations, we illustrate the use of forward or bi-directional pumping scheme to increase the splits further. We also confirm that the Raman pump output in the experiments, despite being below the single mode cut off for the standard SMF, was efficiently coupled into the trunk fibre using off-the-shelf components. We also show using numerical simulations that a flat gain spectrum can be obtained with less than 0.7 dB gain variation across the XG-PON upstream wavelength band (1260-1280 nm) using a multi-wavelength pumping scheme with just two pump wavelengths. From a detailed system analysis, we discuss the impact of broadband filtering (20 nm) at the receiver adopted by the XG-PON standards, and show that lower class (N1) receivers can be adopted for Raman gains higher than 16 dB. © 2016 IEEE.",,10.1109/JLT.2016.2553581,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971232346&doi=10.1109%2fJLT.2016.2553581&partnerID=40&md5=341f8e8540ec2b0e0c6f802c2afb3c15,Article

Although fiber-based QKD has been readily available since several years ago, a global quantum communication network will require the development of space links, which remains to be demonstrated. NICT launched a LEO satellite in 2014 carrying a lasercom terminal (SOTA), designed for in-orbit technological demonstrations. In this paper, we present the results of the campaign to measure the polarization characteristics of the SOTA laser sources after propagating from LEO to ground.

(2016),2016,Indistinguishable single photons with flexible electronic triggering,Optica,"A key ingredient for quantum photonic technologies is an on-demand source of indistinguishable single photons. State-of-the-art indistinguishable single-photon sources typically employ resonant excitation pulses with fixed repetition rates, creating a string of single photons with predetermined arrival times. However, in future applications, an independent electronic signal from a larger quantum circuit or network will trigger the generation of an indistinguishable photon. Further, operating the photon source up to the limit imposed by its lifetime is desirable. Here, we report on the application of a true on-demand approach in which we can electronically trigger the precise arrival time of a single photon as well as control the excitation pulse duration based on resonance fluorescence from a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot. We investigate in detail the effect of the finite duration of an excitation π pulse on the degree of photon antibunching.

Large-scale quantum computing architectures and systems may ultimately require quantum interconnects to enable scaling beyond the limits of a single wafer, and toward multi-chip systems. However, coherently connecting separate chips remains a challenge, due to the fragility of entangled quantum states. The distribution and manipulation of entanglement between multiple integrated devices is one of the strictest requirements of these systems. Here, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first quantum photonic interconnect, demonstrating high-fidelity entanglement distribution and manipulation between two separate photonic chips, implemented using state-of-the-art silicon photonics. Path-entangled states are generated on one chip, and distributed to another chip by interconverting between path and polarization degrees of freedom, via a two-dimensional grating coupler on each chip. This path-to-polarization conversion allows entangled quantum states to be coherently distributed.

The analytical expressions for the polarization of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence along different paths have been derived.

Towards an Emergent Quantum Mechanics in the 21st Century,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"What defines an emergent quantum mechanics (EmQM)? Can new insight be advanced into the nature of quantum nonlocality by seeking new links between quantum and emergent phenomena as described by self-organization, complexity, or emergence theory? Could the development of a future EmQM lead to a unified, relational image of the cosmos? One key motivation for adopting the concept of emergence in relation to quantum theory concerns the persistent failure in standard physics to unify the two pillars in the foundations of physics: quantum theory and general relativity theory (GRT). The total contradiction in the foundational, metaphysical assumptions that define orthodox quantum theory versus GRT might render inter-theoretic unification impossible. On the one hand, indeterminism and non-causality define orthodox quantum mechanics, and, on the other hand, GRT is governed by causality and determinism. How could these two metaphysically-contradictory theories ever be reconciled? The present work argues that metaphysical contradiction necessarily implies physical contradiction. The contradictions are essentially responsible also for the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. A common foundation may be needed for overcoming the contradictions between the two foundational theories. The concept of emergence, and the development of an EmQM, might help advance a common foundation - physical and metaphysical - as required for successfull inter-theory unification. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,10.1088/1742-6596/701/1/012001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964579433&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f701%2f1%2f012001&partnerID=40&md5=38bbb9868a619c06949978ab8d6c5ee9,Conference Paper

In view of its real-world applications, the realization of easy-to-operate experimental systems compatible with existing fiber networks is a crucial step. To comply with these requirements, we demonstrate the feasibility of a squeezing experiment at a telecom wavelength realized, for the first time, in an entirely guided-wave fashion. In our work, the state generation relies on waveguide nonlinear optics technology while squeezing collection and transmission are implemented by using only telecom fiber components. By doing so, we observe up to −1.83 ± 0.05 dB of squeezing emitted at 1542 nm in the CW pumping regime. The compactness and stability of the experiment, compared to free-space configurations, represent a significant advance towards achieving out-of-the-lab continuous variable quantum communications that are fully compatible with long-distance operations in telecom fibers.We believe that this work stands as a promising approach for real applications as well as for “do-it-yourself” experiments. © 2016 Optical Society of America.",,10.1364/OPTICA.3.000362,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964371817&doi=10.1364%2fOPTICA.3.000362&partnerID=40&md5=c06698e72dc91feb4b41625ab9232a6d,Article

At the same time advances in the understanding of the geometrical properties of networks are essential for further progress in quantum gravity. In network geometry, simplicial complexes describing the interaction between two or more nodes play a special role. In fact these structures can be used to discretize a geometrical d-dimensional space, and for this reason they have already been widely used in quantum gravity. Here we introduce the network geometry with flavor s=-1,0,1 (NGF) describing simplicial complexes defined in arbitrary dimension d and evolving by a nonequilibrium dynamics. The NGF can generate discrete geometries of different natures, ranging from chains and higher-dimensional manifolds to scale-free networks with small-world properties, scale-free degree distribution, and nontrivial community structure. The NGF admits as limiting cases both the Bianconi-Barabási models for complex networks, the stochastic Apollonian network, and the recently introduced model for complex quantum network manifolds. The thermodynamic properties of NGF reveal that NGF obeys a generalized area law opening a new scenario for formulating its coarse-grained limit. The structure of NGF is strongly dependent on the dimensionality d. In d=1 NGFs grow complex networks for which the preferential attachment mechanism is necessary in order to obtain a scale-free degree distribution. Instead, for NGF with dimension d>1 it is not necessary to have an explicit preferential attachment rule to generate scale-free topologies. We also show that NGF admits a quantum mechanical description in terms of associated quantum network states. Quantum network states evolve by a Markovian dynamics and a quantum network state at time t encodes all possible NGF evolutions up to time t. Interestingly the NGF remains fully classical but its statistical properties reveal the relation to its quantum mechanical description. In fact the δ-dimensional faces of the NGF have generalized degrees that follow either the Fermi-Dirac, Boltzmann, or Bose-Einstein statistics depending on the flavor s and the dimensions d and δ. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevE.93.032315,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962013224&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevE.93.032315&partnerID=40&md5=e39530426e3eef769424d58f7913381a,Article

However, practical QKD suffers from a number of quantum hackings due to the device imperfections. From the security standpoint, measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is in the limelight since it eliminates all the possible loopholes in detection. Due to active control units for mode matching between the photons from remote parties, however, the implementation of MDI-QKD is highly impractical. In this paper, we propose a method to resolve the mode matching problem while minimizing the use of active control units. By introducing the plug-and-play (P&P) concept into MDI-QKD, the indistinguishability in spectral and polarization modes between photons can naturally be guaranteed.

VIPIC operates in a sparsified streaming mode in which each detected photon is immediately read out as a time- and position-stamped event. This event stream can be fed directly to an autocorrelation engine or accumulated to form a conventional image. The detector only delivers non-zero data (sparsified readout), greatly reducing the communications overhead typical of conventional frame-oriented detectors such as charge-coupled devices or conventional hybrid pixel detectors. This feature allows continuous acquisition of data with timescales from microseconds to hours.

In magnetic materials, chirality gives rise to unconventional phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect and multiferroicity, taking an enhanced flavour in the so-called spin-liquid phases where magnetic disorder prevails. Kagome systems sit at the crossroad of these ideas. Motivated by the recent synthesis of rare-earth kagome materials and the progresses in optical-lattice experiments, we bring together an entire network of spin liquids with anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This network revolves around the Ising antiferromagnet and ends on (ferromagnetic) chiral spin liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. As for the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet, it now belongs to a triad of equivalently disordered phases.

In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the development of the vdW correction. However, the vdW correction based on the leading-order coefficient C6 alone can only achieve limited accuracy, while accurate modeling of higher-order coefficients remains a formidable task, due to the strong non-additivity effect. Here, we apply a model dynamic multipole polarizability within a modified single-frequency approximation to calculate C8 and C10 between small molecules. We find that the higher-order vdW coefficients from this model can achieve remarkable accuracy, with mean absolute relative deviations of 5% for C8 and 7% for C10. Inclusion of accurate higher-order contributions in the vdW correction will effectively enhance the predictive power of DFT in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",,10.1063/1.4940397,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957020542&doi=10.1063%2f1.4940397&partnerID=40&md5=13ab916d987d7aa55f631617aade9b94,Article

(2016),2016,The electronic and transport properties of two-dimensional conjugated polymer networks including disorder,Nanoscale,"Two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers exhibit electronic structures analogous to that of graphene with the peculiarity of π-π∗ bands which are fully symmetric and isolated. In the present letter, the suitability of these materials for electronic applications is analyzed and discussed. In particular, realistic 2D conjugated polymer networks with a structural disorder such as monomer vacancies are investigated. Indeed, during bottom-up synthesis, these irregularities are unavoidable and their impact on the electronic properties is investigated using both ab initio and tight-binding techniques. The tight-binding model is combined with a real space Kubo-Greenwood approach for the prediction of transport characteristics for monomer vacancy concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 2%. As expected, long mean free paths and high mobilities are predicted for low defect densities. At low temperatures and for high defect densities, strong localization phenomena originating from quantum interferences of multiple scattering paths are observed in the close vicinity of the Dirac energy region while the absence of localization effects is predicted away from this region suggesting a sharp mobility transition. These predictions show that 2D conjugated polymer networks are good candidates to pave the way for the ultimate scaling and performances of future molecular nanoelectronic devices. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/c5nr06825h,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954171473&doi=10.1039%2fc5nr06825h&partnerID=40&md5=af7ef706c8be6bb0b44175c488a30d6c,Article

The CdS1-xSex ternary semiconductor materials covering green-red bands have been reported previously, but their basic band-gap and optical properties crucial to the performance of the CdS1-xSex-based optoelectronic devices have not been deeply understood. In this paper, we theoretically simulated and discussed the feasibility of bandgap-tunable CdS1-xSex nanomaterials for designing wavelength tunable microlasers.

1687,Scopus,Nalewajski (2016),2016,Information-Theoretic Probes of Chemical Bonds,Concepts and Methods in Modern Theoretical Chemistry: Electronic Structure and Reactivity,"Information theory (IT) [1-8] is one of the youngest branches of applied probability theory, in which probability ideas have been introduced into the elds of communication, control, and data processing. Its foundations were laid in the 1920s by Fisher [1] in his classical measurement theory and in the 1940s by Shannon [3] in his mathematical theory of communication. The electronic quantum state of a molecule is determined by the system wave function, the amplitude of the particle probability distribution that carries information. It is thus intriguing to explore the information content of electron probability distributions in molecules and to extract from it patterns of chemical bonds, reactivity trends, and other molecular descriptors (e.g., bond multiplicities [”orders”] and their covalent/ionic composition). Indeed, it directly follows from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems of density functional theory (DFT) [9] that all properties of molecular systems are unique functionals of their electron density in their nondegenerate ground state. In this survey, some recent developments in IT probes of molecular electronic structure are summarized. In particular, this survey will examine information displacements due to subtle electron redistributions accompanying bond formation, explore locations of direct chemical bonds using nonadditive information contributions, and examine the pattern of entropic connectivities between atoms in molecules (AIM) resulting from molecular communications between atomic orbitals (AOs). © 2013 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1201/b14048-16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137490888&doi=10.1201%2fb14048-16&partnerID=40&md5=7b1dbfc53af4b523ba37c3c32c3f876e,Book Chapter

1692,Scopus,Pearton et al. (2016),2016,Radiation effects in GaN-based materials and optoelectronic devices,"Advances in Photonics Engineering, Nanophotonics and Biophotonics","Gallium Nitride based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have become attractive for use in high power and high frequency applications. These offer higher breakdown voltages as well as two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density compared to their GaAs counterparts. Some specific applications for nitride HEMTs include air, land and satellite based communications and phased array radar. The development of efficient GaN-based blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) requires alloys with different compositions and their integration into heterojunctions and quantum wells. The realization of efficient blue LEDs has led to white light sources. When a blue LED is used to excite a phosphor material, light is emitted in the green and red spectral ranges, which, combined with the blue light, appears as white. Alternatively, multiple LEDs of red, green and blue can be used together. Both of these technologies are used in high-efficiency white electroluminescent light sources. These light sources are very efficient and long-lived and have begun to replace incandescent and fluorescent lamps for general lighting purposes. Since lighting represents 20-30% of electrical energy consumption, and because GaN white light LEDs require ten times less energy than ordinary light bulbs, the use of efficient blue LEDs leads to significant energy savings. The strong bonding in binary and ternary nitrides gives them an intrinsically high radiation resistance. The response of GaN to radiation damage is a function of radiation type, dose, dose rate, carrier density, impurity content and dislocation density. The latter can act as sinks for created defects and parameters such as the carrier removal rate due to trapping of carriers into radiation-induced defects is found to depend on the crystal growth method used to grow the GaN layers. The growth method has a clear effect on radiation response beyond the carrier type and radiation source. GaN-based devices are more radiation hard than their Si and GaAs counterparts due to the high bond strength in III-nitride materials. In this chapter we review data on the radiation resistance of AlGaN/GaN and InAlN/GaN HEMTs to different types of ionizing radiation. The primary energy levels introduced by different forms of radiation, carrier removal rates and role of existing defects are discussed. The carrier removal rates are a function of initial carrier concentration, dose and dose rate but not of hydrogen concentration in the nitride material grown by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition. Proton and electron irradiation damage in HEMTs creates positive threshold voltage shifts due to a decrease in the two dimensional electron gas concentration resulting from electron trapping at defect sites, as well as a decrease in carrier mobility and degradation of drain current and transconductance. Neutron irradiation created more extended damage regions and at high doses leads to Fermi level pinning while 60Co γ-ray irradiation leads to much smaller changes in HEMT drain current relative to the other forms of radiation. We have not seen any significant effect on the carrier loss rate in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs during either 10 MeV electron or 10 MeV proton irradiation to total doses of 1013 cm-2 (protons) or 1015 cm-2 (electrons) over a range of almost two orders of magnitude in dose rate for both types of radiation. In terms of InGaN/GaN blue LEDs irradiated with protons, both current-voltage and light output-current characteristics were degraded with increasing the proton dose. The optical performance of the LEDs was much more sensitive to the proton irradiation than that of the corresponding electrical performances. The electroluminescence spectra and the light output intensity before and after proton irradiation showed similar trends in degradation. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Meeting future domestic needs AND accessing large global market of space will require a quantum jump in Indian capabilities and capacities. Another aspect is growth and aspirations of Indian economy - GDP growth around 7-8 In an earlier study, we have outlined the future 10-20 years of policy perspectives for Indian Space and also outlined the perspectives of a National Space Eco-system of a ""public-private-academia triad"".

1694,Scopus,Lawrence et al. (2016),2016,On-board processing of synthetic aperture radar data,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","As the quantity of data collected by satellite-based missions continues to increase, so too does the need for on-board processing. This is especially true for missions in which only a subset of the acquired data is considered useful or an immediate response to the data collected is needed. By processing data on-board a satellite, the quantity of downlinked data can be reduced, thus improving numerous mission parameters including power consumption, payload performance, and data latency. Accordingly, an ideal candidate for on-board processing would be a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite mission performing ship detection over large bodies of water, as any imagery that does not contain ships is of a lower value for this application. Implementing on-board processing can be challenging, considering space-based conventional processors lag their ground-based counterparts by several generations. However, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer an alternative viable solution, as they have been shown to provide adequate tolerance to radiation, and achieve excellent performance. Moreover, the advent of high-level synthesis tools now allows for the rapid development and testing of FPGA algorithms. Consequently, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has conducted a study to explore the feasibility of on-board processing of SAR data. A SAR processor based on the Spectral Analysis (SPECAN) algorithm was developed, converted to RTL using a high-level synthesis tool, and implemented on a low-power (2W), low-mass (24g), processing card named the Q7, which was developed by Xiphos Technologies. Testing of the algorithm's performance on the Q7 is currently underway. This study is part of a larger body of work funded by CSA's technology development program, which aims at demonstrating Xiphos' tools for several applications including hyperspectral data compression, quantum communications and planetary exploration rovers. This paper will discuss the need for on-board processing, provide an overview of the Q7 card, describe the SAR processor algorithm that was developed and implemented in hardware and finally, present the performance results on the development board.

From the preceding study on the quantum stream cipher, we recognized that the quantum stream cipher by Y00 protocol would be able to be generalized to a new type of physical cipher that has potential to exceed the Shannon limit by installing additional randomization mechanisms, in accordance with the law of quantum mechanics. We call this new type of physical random cipher the quantum enigma cipher. In this article, we introduce the recent developments for the quantum stream cipher by Y00 protocol and future plans toward the quantum enigma cipher. © 2016 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2237570,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007017043&doi=10.1117%2f12.2237570&partnerID=40&md5=b099ba84b9b0dafc6e3b5228f79bedfd,Conference Paper
1697,Scopus,El & (2016),2016,An efficient lattice-based multisignature scheme with applications to bitcoins,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Multisignature schemes constitute important primitives when it comes to save the storage and bandwidth costs in presence of multiple signers. Such constructions are extensively used in financial applications such as Bitcoins, where more than one key is required in order to authorize Bitcoin transactions. However, many of the current stateof- the-art multisignature schemes are based on the RSA or discrete-log assumptions, which may become insecure in the future, for example due to the possibility of quantum attacks. In this paper we propose a new multisignature scheme that is built on top of the intractability of lattice problems that remain hard to solve even in presence of powerful quantum computers. The size of a multisignature is quasi optimal and our scheme can also easily be transformed into a more general aggregate signature scheme. Finally, we give an efficient implementation of the scheme which testifies its practicality and competitive capacity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,10.1007/978-3-319-48965-0_9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994802234&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-48965-0_9&partnerID=40&md5=2873968e98dff0a575d138917383272b,Conference Paper

(2016),2016,Computing a nonnegative matrix factorization-provably,SIAM Journal on Computing,"In the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem we are given an n × m nonnegative matrix M and an integer r &gt; 0. Our goal is to express M as AW, where A and W are nonnegative matrices of size n×r and r×m, respectively. In some applications, it makes sense to ask instead for the product AW to approximate M, i.e. (approximately) minimize ||M - AWF||, where || ||F,denotes the Frobenius norm; we refer to this as approximate NMF. This problem has a rich history spanning quantum mechanics, probability theory, data analysis, polyhedral combinatorics, communication complexity, demography, chemometrics, etc. In the past decade NMF has become enormously popular in machine learning, where A and W are computed using a variety of local search heuristics. Vavasis recently proved that this problem is NP-complete. (Without the restriction that A and W be nonnegative, both the exact and approximate problems can be solved optimally via the singular value decomposition.) We initiate a study of when this problem is solvable in polynomial time. Our results are the following: 1. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for exact and approximate NMF for every constant r. Indeed NMF is most interesting in applications precisely when r is small. 2. We complement this with a hardness result, that if exact NMF can be solved in time (nm)o(r), 3-SAT has a subexponential-time algorithm. This rules out substantial improvements to the above algorithm. 3. We give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in n, m, and r under the separablity condition identified by Donoho and Stodden in 2003. The algorithm may be practical since it is simple and noise tolerant (under benign assumptions). Separability is believed to hold in many practical settings. To the best of our knowledge, this last result is the first example of a polynomial-time algorithm that provably works under a non-trivial condition on the input and we believe that this will be an interesting and important direction for future work. © 2016 the authors.",,10.1137/130913869,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990975264&doi=10.1137%2f130913869&partnerID=40&md5=2521dbd71b38625f67e23329d580a842,Conference Paper

At the same time, all of them are composed from chemical elements many of which have magnetic and non-magnetic stable isotopes. Here I present the mini-review of our recent works in which MIE of magnesium have been revealed in living nature. Mg has three stable isotopes, 24Mg, 25Mg and 26Mg with natural abundance of ≈79, 10 and 11%, from which only 25Mg is magnetic isotope (nuclear spin I = 5/2) whereas 24Mg and 26Mg are nonmagnetic isotopes (nuclear spin I = 0). In experiments with yeast cells, S. cerevisiae, it was revealed that enrichment of the cells with magnetic isotope, 25Mg, gives the two-fold increase in the rate constant of post-radiation recovery when compared to the cells enriched with the non-magnetic magnesium isotope. In experiments with another commonly accepted cell model, E. coli, it was revealed that bacteria essentially faster adapt to the growth media enriched with 25Mg by comparison to the media enriched with 24Mg or 26Mg. Furthermore, in cooperation with Palladin Institute of Biochemistry, Kyiv, Ukraine, it was revealed that 25Mg essentially, 2-2.5 times by comparison to the spin-less 24Mg or 26Mg, accelerates ATP hydrolysis driven by myosin, one of the most important protein nanoreactors of cell bioenergetics. The experimental results provide the grounds of believing that pharmaceutical agents, enriched with 25Mg or possibly with magnetic isotopes of some other elements, will find use in nuclear nano-biotechnology and nano-medicine for creating novel anti-stress drugs including anti-radiation protectors. Besides, they open novel ways for control over efficiency and reliability of nanoreactors in optical communications, quantum information processing, computational schemes and the like.",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988938540&partnerID=40&md5=c2fb6bdb188e4e46af1e051c34c66712,Conference Paper

Unlike bipolar semiconductor lasers, stimulated emission in QCLs is obtained via electronic transitions between discrete energy states inside the conduction band. Recent technological progress has led to QCLs operating in pulsed or continuous wave mode, at room temperature in single- or multi-mode operation, with high powers up to a few watts for mid-IR devices. This spectacular development raises multiple interrogations on the stability of QCLs as little is known on their dynamical properties. Very recently, experiments based on optical spectrum measurements have unveiled the existence of five distinct feedback regimes without, however, identifying the complex dynamics dwelling within the QCL. In this article we provide the first experimental evidence of a route to chaos in a QCL emitting at mid-IR wavelength. When applying optical feedback with an increasing strength, the QCL dynamics bifurcate to periodic dynamics at the external cavity frequency and later to chaos without an undamping of relaxation oscillations, hence contrasting with the well-known scenarios occurring in interband laser diodes. © 2016 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2213434,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986879728&doi=10.1117%2f12.2213434&partnerID=40&md5=8b2f338b6a069dfab99b6b8e6249d19a,Conference Paper

However, with increasing features being added into the studies, the performance growth trend of SRL is gradually slowing down. So new ways must be found to improve the performance of semantic analysis. Word sense information is useful for SRL task. But how to effectively make use of word sense information is a key issue. Referring to synergetics, we can regard semantic analysis process as competitive process of many semantics order parameters under coherent action and interactive collaboration of semantic role-related features and word sense-related features. Accordingly, we propose a semantic role labeling model with word sense information based on improved synergetic neural network (SNN). Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, role-related features and word sense-related features are used to configure semantic order parameters of SNN. Secondly, network parameters are reconstructed which can reflect the relationship of driving and restraining each other between various linguistic features. Finally, we use an improved quantum particle swarm algorithm (QPSO) to realize the optimization of network parameter which has stronger search ability and faster convergence speed.

While fast communications can be realized using laser communications in fiber and free-space, inherently secure communications can be achieved using quantum key distribution (QKD). By combining both technologies in a single device, many synergies can be exploited, therefore reducing size, weight and power of future systems. In recent experiments we demonstrated quantum communications over large distances as well as between an aircraft and a ground station which proved the feasibility of QKD between moving partners. Satellites thus may be used as trusted nodes in combination with QKD receiver stations on ground, thereby enabling fast and secure communications on a global scale. We discuss the previous experiment with emphasis on necessary developments to be done and corresponding ongoing research work of German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Ludwig Maximilians University Munich (LMU). DLR is performing research on satellite and ground terminals for the high-rate laser communication component, which are enabling technologies for the QKD link. We describe the concept and hardware of three generations of OSIRIS (Optical High Speed Infrared Link System) laser communication terminals for low Earth orbiting satellites. The first type applies laser beam pointing solely based on classical satellite control, the second uses an optical feedback to the satellite bus and the third, currently being in design phase, comprises of a special coarse pointing assembly to control beam direction independent of satellite orientation. Ongoing work also targets optical terminals for CubeSats. A further increase of beam pointing accuracy can be achieved with a fine pointing assembly. Two ground stations will be available for future testing, an advanced stationary ground station and a transportable ground station. In parallel the LMU QKD source size will be reduced by more than an order of magnitude thereby simplifying its integration into future free-space optical communication links with CubeSats. © 2016 COPYRIGHT SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2230232,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84984986349&doi=10.1117%2f12.2230232&partnerID=40&md5=f261e84ca63b03295ffd637a8b63b48d,Conference Paper

However, little has been reported on reliability and failure modes of InGaAs VCSELs emitting at ∼980 nm although it is crucial to understand failure modes and underlying degradation mechanisms in developing these VCSELs that exceed lifetime requirements for space missions. The active layer of commercial VCSELs that we studied consisted of two or three InGaAs quantum wells. The laser structures were fabricated into deep mesas followed by a steam oxidation process to form oxide-apertures for current and optical confinements. Our multi-mode VCSELs showed a laser threshold of ∼ 0.5 mA at RT. Failures were generated via accelerated life-testing of VCSELs. For the present study, we report on failure mode analysis of degraded oxide-VCSELs using various techniques. We employed nondestructive techniques including electroluminescence (EL), optical beam induced current (OBIC), and electron beam induced current (EBIC) techniques as well as destructive techniques including focused ion beam (FIB) and high-resolution TEM techniques to study VCSELs that showed different degradation behaviors. Especially, we employed FIB systems to locally remove a portion of top-DBR mirrors of degraded VCSELs, which made it possible for our subsequent EBIC and OBIC techniques to locate damaged areas that were generated as a result of degradation processes and also for our HR-TEM technique to prepare TEM cross sections from damaged areas.

1705,Scopus,Zeitler et al. (2016),2016,Super-dense teleportation for space applications,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Establishing a quantum communication network would provide advantages in areas such as security and information processing. Such a network would require the implementation of quantum teleportation between remote parties. However, for photonic «qudits» of dimension greater than two, this teleportation always fails due to the inability to carry out the required quantum Bell-state measurement. A quantum communication protocol called Superdense Teleportation (SDT) can allow the reconstruction of a state without the usual 2-photon Bell-state measurements, enabling the protocol to succeed deterministically even for high dimensional qudits. This technique restricts the class of states transferred to equimodular states, a type of superposition state where each term can differ from the others in phase but not in amplitude; this restricted space of transmitted states allows the transfer to occur deterministically. We report on our implementation of SDT using photon pairs that are entangled in both polarization and temporal mode. After encoding the phases of the desired equimodular state on the signal photon, we perform a complete tomography on the idler photon to verify that we properly prepared the chosen state. Beyond our tabletop demonstration, we are working towards an implementation between a space platform in low earth orbit and a ground telescope, to demonstrate the feasibility of space-based quantum communication. We will discuss the various challenges presented by moving the experiment out of the laboratory, and our proposed solutions to make Superdense Teleportation realizable in the space setting. © 2016 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2218282,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976589855&doi=10.1117%2f12.2218282&partnerID=40&md5=d919ff9d7cb201e1f47e70a51c186bfc,Conference Paper

Peptoid helices, which result from the incorporation of bulky chiral side chains, are a key peptoid structural motif whose formation has not yet been accurately modeled in molecular simulations. Here, we report that a simple modification of the backbone φ-angle potential in GAFF is able to produce well-folded cis-amide helices of (S)-N-(1-phenylethyl)glycine (Nspe), consistent with experiment. We validate our results against both QM calculations and NMR experiments. For this latter task, we make quantitative comparisons to sparse NOE data using the Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) algorithm, a method we have recently developed for this purpose. We then performed extensive REMD simulations of Nspe oligomers as a function of chain length and temperature to probe the molecular forces driving cooperative helix formation. Analysis of simulation data by Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory show that the modified potential predicts much more cooperative folding for Nspe helices. Unlike peptides, per-residue entropy changes for helix nucleation and extension are mostly positive, suggesting that steric bulk provides the main driving force for folding.

To confirm whether the structures are indeed the acceptable ones, we go on to evaluate several properties like IR spectroscopic modes, vertical excitation energy, cluster formation energy, vertical ionisation potential and the HOMO-LUMO gap. We stress on the fact that an initial estimation of structure using GA, on two empirical potentials (with and without inclusion of polarisation), leads to a very quick convergence to structures which are quite close to the structures obtained from quantum chemical calculations done from the outset, such as using a DFT calculation. The general structural trend of these systems to form three-dimensional networks is also clear from our study.

These channels serve both to directly exchange quantum information between nodes and to distribute entanglement over the whole network.

Besides being conceptually appealing, this approach is promising for quantum networks on larger scales, as it gives access to long qubit coherence times and high light-matter coupling efficiencies. Thus, it allows one to generate entangled photons on the push of a button, to reversibly map the quantum state of a photon onto an atom, to transfer and teleport quantum states between remote atoms, to entangle distant atoms, to detect optical photons nondestructively, to perform entangling quantum gates between an atom and one or several photons, and even provides a route toward efficient heralded quantum memories for future repeaters. The presented general protocols and the identification of key parameters are applicable to other experimental systems. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/RevModPhys.87.1379,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954167220&doi=10.1103%2fRevModPhys.87.1379&partnerID=40&md5=ef9d46e12a14cd50c617897dfac1b370,Article

This calls for more advanced techniques in a future global quantum network, e.g., for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation of an entangled state, i.e., entanglement swapping, representing the central resource to relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater. Since the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in realworld scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a freespace entanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 SDs beyond the classical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the independence of the nodes is highly demanded.

The main idea of this method is to use different broadband chaotic phase shifts, generated by electro-optic modulators and chaotic Colpitts circuits, to encode the information-bearing quantum signals coming from different users and then recover the masked quantum signals at the receiver side by imposing opposite chaotic phase shifts. The chaotic phase shifts given to different pairs of users are almost uncorrelated due to the randomness of chaos and thus the quantum signals from different pair of users can be distinguished even when they are sent via the same quantum channel. It is shown that two maximally entangled states can be generated between two pairs of users by our method mediated by bright coherent lights, which can be more easily implemented in experiments compared with single-photon lights.

Finally, the single-step prediction experiment is conducted on the chaotic time series produced by fractional order Birkhoff-shaw and Jerk chaotic systems according to Adams- Bashforth-Moulton estimation-correction algorithm respectively, and the simulation results show that the NOB neural network based on QPSO algorithm is superior to the NOB neural network based on the traditional Gradient Descent (GD) method, BP neural network and RBF neural network in model structure, prediction precision and convergence speed. © 2015 by Binary Information Press.",,10.12733/jcis15412,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84950134353&doi=10.12733%2fjcis15412&partnerID=40&md5=4637e542117528cdf8fff816bc45d5ac,Article

An important feature of this Multivariate Pubic Key Cryptography (MPKC) is the resistance to quantum computers: no faster quantum algorithm than classical ones to solve MQ problem is known.

In this paper, we present a quantum teleportation procedure that capable to teleport either accelerated or non-accelerated information through different quantum channels. These quantum channels are based on accelerated multi-qubit states, where each qubit of each of these channels represents a partner. Namely, these states are the W state, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the GHZ-like state. Here, we show that the fidelity of teleporting accelerated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non-accelerated information, both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state. Also, the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that the degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel, type of the measurement, and value of the acceleration. The result of comparison concludes that teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is more robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the other two states.

In this paper, we will describe an alternative approach to realize the near complete logic Bell-state analysis for the polarized concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state with two logic qubits. We show that the logic Bell-state can be distinguished in two steps with the help of the parity-check measurement (PCM) constructed by the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. This approach can be also used to distinguish arbitrary C-GHZ state with N logic qubits.

1741,Scopus,Baldacci et al. (2015),2015,Coherent perfect absorption in photonic structures,Rendiconti Lincei,"The ability to drive a system with an external input is a fundamental aspect of light–matter interaction. The coherent perfect absorption (CPA) phenomenon extends to the general multibeam interference phenomenology the well-known critical coupling concepts (Haus in Waves and fields in optoelectronics. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1984; Yariv and Yeh in Optical Electronics in Modern Communication. Oxford University Press, New York, 2007). The latter detail the conditions under which the energy of the input field is fed in full to the absorbing element. In a multi-port system, the relative phase of the incoming fields can yield the ultimate control of the absorption, from CPA to complete transparency (coherent perfect transparency, CPT), and also beyond, in amplifying regimes, to laser threshold control (Longhi in Phys Rev A 82:031801, 2010; Sun et al. in Phys Rev Lett 112:143903, 2014). This interferometric control of absorption can be employed to reach perfect energy feeding into nanoscale systems such as plasmonic nanoparticles (Noh et al. in Phys Rev Lett 108(18):186805, 2012), and multi-port interference can be used to enhance the absorption when they are embedded in a strongly scattering system (Chong and Stone in Phys Rev Lett 107(16):163901, 2011), with potential applications to nanoscale sensing. Here we review the two-port CPA in reference to photonic structures which can resonantly couple to the external fields. A revised two-port theory of CPA is illustrated, which relies on the Scattering Matrix formalism and is valid for all linear two-port systems with reciprocity. Through a semiclassical approach, treating two-port critical coupling conditions in a non-perturbative regime, it is demonstrated that the strong-coupling regime and the critical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, termed strong critical coupling (Zanotto et al. in Nature Phys 10(11):830–834, 2014), all the incoming energy is converted into polaritons. Experimental results are presented, which clearly display the elliptical trace of absorption as function of input unbalance in a thin metallo-dielectric metamaterial, and verify polaritonic CPA in an intersubband polariton photonic crystal membrane resonator.

In other words, we must find a completely positive linear map, if it exists, that maps a given set of density matrices to another given set of density matrices, possibly of different dimension. Using the theory of completely positive linear maps, one can formulate the problem as an instance of a positive semidefinite feasibility problem with highly structured constraints. The nature of the constraints makes projection-based algorithms very appealing when the number of variables is huge and standard interior-point methods for semidefinite programming are not applicable.

(2015),2015,Multilayer RTD-memristor-based cellular neural networks for color image processing,Neurocomputing,"Multilayer cellular neural networks (CNNs) with multiple state variables in each cell associated with multiple dynamic rules are believed to possess more powerful data computing and signal processing capabilities than single-layer CNNs and are specially suitable for solving complex problems. However, at present, their large scale integrated hardware implementation is still quite challenging based on traditional CMOS-based technology due to high circuity complexity and their applications are thus limited in practice. In this paper, a novel compact multilayer CNN model based on nanometer scale resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) and memristors is presented. More specifically, in this model, one multilayer CNN cell consists of several sub-cells located in different layers. The resonant tunneling diode with quantum tunneling induced nonlinearity and uniquely folded current-voltage characteristics is used to implement the compact and high-speed cell via replacing the original linear resistor and removing the output function of conventional CNN cells. Furthermore, the interactions between these cells are determined by a pair of multi-dimensional cloning templates. And a compact synaptic circuit based on memristors is designed to realize the cloning template parameter (weight strength) and the multiplication (weighting) operation, by leveraging its nonvolatility, good scalability, and variable conductance. The combination of these desirable elements equips the proposed multilayer CNN with advantages of powerful processing capability as well as high compactness, versatility, and possibility of very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit implementations. Finally, the performance of the proposed multilayer CNN is validated by five illustrative examples in color image processing with each layer dealing with each primary color (red, green or blue) plane. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",,10.1016/j.neucom.2015.03.057,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929282155&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2015.03.057&partnerID=40&md5=5d8a269b152c662d5ed32e6b7f66bf34,Article

Hence, determining the thermophysical properties and understanding these novel mixtures at the molecular level are of both fundamental and practical importance. In this context, here we report the synthesis of two nontoxic guanidinium cation based ILs, tetramethylguanidinium benzoate [TMG][BEN] and tetramethylguanidinium salicylate [TMG][SAL], and present a detailed comparison of their thermophysical properties in the presence of water. The results show that the [TMG][SAL]/water mixtures have higher density and higher apparent molar volume, but a lower viscosity and higher compressibility than the [TNG][BEN]/water mixtures. The measured viscosity and compressibility data are explained from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations and liquid-phase molecular dynamics simulations, where salicylate anions of denser [TMG][SAL]/water were found to exist as isolated ions due to intramolecular H-bonding. On the contrary, intermolecular H-bonding among the benzoate anions and their strong tendency to form an extended H-bonding network with water made [TMG][BEN]/water solutions more viscous and less compressible. This study shows the importance of probing these emerging solvents at the molecular-to-atomic level, which could be helpful in their optimal usage for task-specific applications.

In contrast to most conventional potentials, which are based on physical approximations and simplifications to derive an analytic functional relation between the atomic configuration and the potential-energy, ML potentials rely on simple but very flexible mathematical terms without a direct physical meaning. Instead, in case of ML potentials the topology of the potential-energy surface is ""learned"" by adjusting a number of parameters with the aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible. Due to this bias-free construction, they are applicable to a wide range of systems without changes in their functional form, and a very high accuracy close to the underlying first-principles data can be obtained. Neural network potentials (NNPs), which have first been proposed about two decades ago, are an important class of ML potentials. Although the first NNPs have been restricted to small molecules with only a few degrees of freedom, they are now applicable to high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms, which enables addressing a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this tutorial review, the basic ideas of NNPs are presented with a special focus on developing NNPs for high-dimensional condensed systems.

All levels and lines are based on critically reviewed and validated high-resolution experimental spectra taken from 56 literature sources. The transition data are in the 0.7-17000cm-1 region, with a large gap between 7000 and 15000cm-1. The MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) algorithm is used to determine the energy levels. Out of the 29450 measured transitions 10041 and 18947 belong to ortho- and para-14NH3, respectively. A careful analysis of the related experimental spectroscopic network (SN) allows 28530 of the measured transitions to be validated, 18178 of these are unique, while 462 transitions belong to floating components. Despite the large number of spectroscopic measurements published over the last 80 years, the transitions determine only 30 vibrational band origins of 14NH3, 8 for ortho- and 22 for para-14NH3. The highest J value, where J stands for the rotational quantum number, for which an energy level is validated is 31. The number of experimental-quality ortho- and para-14NH3 rovibrational energy levels is 1724 and 3237, respectively. The MARVEL energy levels are checked against ones in the BYTe first-principles database, determined previously. The lists of validated lines and levels for 14NH3 are deposited in the Supporting Information to this paper. Combination of the MARVEL energy levels with first-principles absorption intensities yields a huge number of experimental-quality rovibrational lines, which should prove to be useful for the understanding of future complex high-resolution spectroscopy on 14NH3; these lines are also deposited in the Supporting Information to this paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1016/j.jqsrt.2015.03.034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928658818&doi=10.1016%2fj.jqsrt.2015.03.034&partnerID=40&md5=bd7a61abd7ffa99abd2a081bf96bbc66,Article
1754,Scopus,Streltsov et al. (2015),2015,Progress towards a unified approach to entanglement distribution,"Physical Review A - Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics","Entanglement distribution is key to the success of secure communication schemes based on quantum mechanics, and there is a strong need for an ultimate architecture able to overcome the limitations of recent proposals such as those based on entanglement percolation or quantum repeaters. In this work we provide a broad theoretical background for the development of such technologies. In particular, we investigate the question of whether entanglement distribution is more efficient if some amount of entanglement - or some amount of correlations in general - is available prior to the transmission stage of the protocol. We show that in the presence of noise the answer to this question strongly depends on the type of noise and on the way the entanglement is quantified. On the one hand, subadditive entanglement measures do not show an advantage of preshared correlations if entanglement is established via combinations of single-qubit Pauli channels. On the other hand, based on the superadditivity conjecture of distillable entanglement, we provide evidence that this phenomenon occurs for this measure. These results strongly suggest that sending one half of some pure entangled state down a noisy channel is the best strategy for any subadditive entanglement quantifier, thus paving the way to a unified approach for entanglement distribution which does not depend on the nature of noise. We also provide general bounds for entanglement distribution involving quantum discord and present a counterintuitive phenomenon of the advantage of arbitrarily little entangled states over maximally entangled ones, which may also occur for quantum channels relevant in experiments. © 2015 American Physical Society. ©2015 American Physical Society.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.92.012335,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938709354&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.92.012335&partnerID=40&md5=05af56b0907a44b31389e230dd0c6708,Article

The structures of the cyclometalating and diimine ligands were changed systematically to investigate the effects of the substituents on the dual-emission properties of the complexes. On the basis of the photophysical data, the high-energy (HE) and low-energy (LE) emission features of the complexes were assigned to triplet intraligand (3IL) and triplet charge-transfer (3CT) excited states, respectively. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations supported these assignments and indicated that the dual emission resulted from the interruption of the communication between the higher-lying 3IL and the lower-lying 3CT states by a triplet amine-to-ligand charge-transfer (3NLCT) state. Also, the avidin-binding properties of the biotin complexes were studied by emission titrations, and the results showed that the dual-emissive complexes can be utilized as ratiometric probes for avidin. Additionally, all the complexes exhibited efficient cellular uptake by live HeLa cells. The MTT and Annexin V assays confirmed that no cell death and early apoptosis occurred during the cell imaging experiments. Interestingly, laser-scanning confocal microscopy revealed that the complexes were selectively localized on the cell membrane, mitochondria, or both, depending on the nature of the substituents of the ligands. The results of this work will contribute to the future development of dual-emissive transition metal complexes as ratiometric probes and organelle-selective bioimaging reagents.

1759,Scopus,Dorval et al. (2015),2015,Constructing Multifunctional Virus-Templated Nanoporous Composites for Thin Film Solar Cells: Contributions of Morphology and Optics to Photocurrent Generation,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,"Biotemplates, such as the high aspect ratio M13 bacteriophage, can be used to nucleate noble metal nanoparticles and photoactive materials such as metal oxides, as well as organize them into continuous structures. Such attributes make them attractive scaffolds for solar applications requiring precise organization at the nanoscale. For instance, thin film solar cells benefit from nanostructured morphologies that aid light absorption and carrier transport. Here, we present a biotemplating strategy for assembling nanostructured thin film solar cells that enhance the generated photocurrent through two features: (1) a nanoporous and continuous M13 bacteriophage-templated titania network that improves charge collection and (2) the incorporation of metal nanoparticles within the active layer of the device to improve light harvesting. We demonstrate our ability to construct virus-templated solar cells by applying this strategy to depleted titania-lead sulfide quantum dot (PbS QD) bulk heterojunctions. The titania morphology produced by our biotemplate allows charges to be efficiently collected from the bulk of the active material and light that is otherwise poorly absorbed by the QDs to be harvested using metal nanoparticles that exhibit plasmon resonances in the visible range. We show that high aspect ratio bacteriophages provide a structural template for synthesizing titania networks with tunable porosity, into which PbS QDs are infiltrated to create photoactive nanocomposites suitable for photovoltaics. Upon optimization, the generated photocurrent and power conversion efficiency of the bacteriophage-templated devices demonstrate a 2-fold improvement over those of control devices made with randomly organized titania nanoparticles. When the virus is complexed with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), or silver nanoplates (Ag NPLs) during assembly, the device performance is further improved, with Ag NPLs enhancing the short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency by 16% and 36.5%, respectively, over those of virus-based devices without NPs. The observed trends in photocurrent enhancement match well with numerical predictions, and the role of the nanostructured morphology on the device optics was computationally explored. The challenges overcome in this work could be extended to other heterojunction devices, such as hybrid systems involving conducting polymers, as well as other biologically templated electronics. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b00295,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84933074354&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpcc.5b00295&partnerID=40&md5=715182390d2ba789e0fa1b9bb99581fe,Article

Existing structure prototypes can now be readily evaluated beforehand not only to map out trends on target properties or for candidate composition selection but also for gaining insights on structure-property relationships. Recently, the tavorite structure has been determined to be capable of a fast Li ion insertion rate for battery cathode applications. Taking this inspiration, we surveyed the LiMTO4F tavorite system (M3+-T5+ and M2+-T6+ pairs; M is nontransition metals) for solid electrolyte use, identifying promising compositions with enormously low Li migration energy (ME) and understanding how structure parameters affect or modulate ME. We employed a combination of DFT computation, variable interaction analysis, graph theory, and a neural network for building a crystal structure-based ME prediction model. Candidate compositions that were predicted include LiGaPO4F (0.25 eV), LiGdPO4F (0.30 eV), LiDyPO4F (0.30 eV), LiMgSO4F (0.21 eV), and LiMgSeO4F (0.11 eV). With chemical substitutions at M and T sites, competing effects among Li pathway bottleneck size, polyanion covalency, and local lattice distortion were determined to be crucial for controlling ME. A way to predict ME for multiple structure types within the neural network framework was also explored.

Additionally, WSi SNSPD devices with 12-pixels have recently demonstrated downlink data rates of 79 Mbps between a terminal in orbit around the moon and a terminal on earth, as part of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) at the Lunar Lasercomm OCTL Terminal (LLOT). To further extend the performance of SNSPD devices for optical and quantum communication for terrestrial and space-based applications, the next generation of devices will need to incorporate hundreds to thousands of SNSPD pixels and to be free-space coupled. The wire widths necessary for optimal performance of WSi (~120-220 nm) devices have to date been achieved using electron-beam lithography (EBL) to pattern photoresists for etch-back fabrication methods. The high cost and time to fabricate kilo-pixel arrays of SNSPDs using EBL will become prohibitive in producing such devices. Here, we report fabrication of a WSi SNSPD test structure with 64 pixels using optical lithography instead of EBL. Specifically, we used Canon EX3 and EX6 deep-UV (DUV) steppers with KrF excimer lasers (λ = 248 nm) in the Micro Devices Laboratory at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to fabricate the array. Dies with 8 × 8 pixels with 166-nm-wide wires were produced, with pixels having a 100 μm pitch in the vertical and horizontal directions. Two improvements were observed: 1) the time to pattern the 8 × 8 SNSPD pixels on 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm dies filling a 4-in Si wafer required ~24 hours using EBL while optical lithography wrote the same dies in approximately 15 minutes; and 2) the cost to write one 4-in wafer using EBL was comparable to the cost for one optical mask for use in the stepper to write many 4-in wafers. While fabrication times and costs will vary from facility to facility, the improvements in speed and cost for optical lithography versus EBL are apparent, and this technological advance should scale and enable fast and rapid production of kilo-pixel arrays in the future. © 2014 IEEE.",,10.1109/TASC.2014.2378232,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925114981&doi=10.1109%2fTASC.2014.2378232&partnerID=40&md5=173eaaafe6b33e2aee0c446ce27622be,Article

(2015),2015,Quantum coherent optical phase modulation in an ultrafast transmission electron microscope,Nature,"Coherent manipulation of quantum systems with light is expected to be a cornerstone of future information and communication technology, including quantum computation and cryptography. The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum wavefunction is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of quantum state preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated electron states near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of attosecond science, including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and orbital tomography. In contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of energetic free-electron beams has not been demonstrated, although it promises direct access to ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses on the attosecond scale. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum state manipulation of free-electron populations in an electron microscope beam. We employ the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with optical near-fields to induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of electron momentum states, observed as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent agreement with the scaling of an equal-Rabi multilevel quantum ladder is obtained, representing the observation of a light-driven 'quantum walk' coherently reshaping electron density in momentum space. We note that, after the interaction, the optically generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond electron pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the precision structuring of electron densities, with possible applications ranging from ultrafast electron spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and free-electron lasers. ©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The focus in this part is on high-level quantum chemical calculations of the thermochemical quantities of relatively heavy metabolites such as amino acids/oligopeptides, nucleosides, saccharides and their derivatives in the ideal gas state. The results of this study will be combined with the corresponding hydration/solvation results in subsequent parts of this work in order to derive the desired thermochemical quantities in aqueous solutions. The above metabolites exist in a vast conformational/isomerization space including rotational conformers, tautomers or anomers exhibiting often multiple or cooperative intramolecular hydrogen bonding. We examine the challenges posed by these features for the reliable estimation of thermochemical quantities. We discuss conformer search, conformer distribution and averaging processes. We further consider neutral metabolites as well as protonated and deprotonated metabolites. In addition to the traditional presentation of gas-phase acidities, basicities and proton affinities, we also examine heats and free energies of ionic species. We obtain simple linear relations between the thermochemical quantities of ions and the formation quantities of their neutral counterparts.

(2015),2015,Limitations on quantum key repeaters,Nature Communications,"A major application of quantum communication is the distribution of entangled particles for use in quantum key distribution. Owing to noise in the communication line, quantum key distribution is, in practice, limited to a distance of a few hundred kilometres, and can only be extended to longer distances by use of a quantum repeater, a device that performs entanglement distillation and quantum teleportation. The existence of noisy entangled states that are undistillable but nevertheless useful for quantum key distribution raises the question of the feasibility of a quantum key repeater, which would work beyond the limits of entanglement distillation, hence possibly tolerating higher noise levels than existing protocols. Here we exhibit fundamental limits on such a device in the form of bounds on the rate at which it may extract secure key. As a consequence, we give examples of states suitable for quantum key distribution but unsuitable for the most general quantum key repeater protocol. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

(2015),2015,Four-wave mixing experiments with extreme ultraviolet transient gratings,Nature,"Four-wave mixing (FWM) processes, based on third-order nonlinear light-matter interactions, can combine ultrafast time resolution with energy and wavevector selectivity, and enable the exploration of dynamics inaccessible by linear methods. The coherent and multi-wave nature of the FWM approach has been crucial in the development of advanced technologies, such as silicon photonics, subwavelength imaging and quantum communications. All these technologies operate at optical wavelengths, which limits the spatial resolution and does not allow the probing of excitations with energy in the electronvolt range. Extension to shorter wavelengths - that is, the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray ranges - would allow the spatial resolution to be improved and the excitation energy range to be expanded, as well as enabling elemental selectivity to be achieved by exploiting core resonances. So far, FWM applications at such wavelengths have been prevented by the absence of coherent sources of sufficient brightness and of suitable experimental set-ups. Here we show how transient gratings, generated by the interference of coherent extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by the FERMI free-electron laser, can be used to stimulate FWM processes at suboptical wavelengths. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the possibility of observing the time evolution of the FWM signal, which shows the dynamics of coherent excitations as molecular vibrations. This result opens the way to FWM with nanometre spatial resolution and elemental selectivity, which, for example, would enable the investigation of charge-transfer dynamics. The theoretical possibility of realizing these applications has already stimulated ongoing developments of free-electron lasers: our results show that FWM at suboptical wavelengths is feasible, and we hope that they will enable advances in present and future photon sources. ©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

1784,Scopus,Aysu et al. (2015),2015,The future of real-time security: Latency-optimized lattice-based digital signatures,ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems,"Advances in quantum computing have spurred a significant amount of research into public-key cryptographic algorithms that are resistant against postquantum cryptanalysis. Lattice-based cryptography is one of the important candidates because of its reasonable complexity combined with reasonable signature sizes. However, in a postquantum world, not only the cryptography will change but also the computing platforms. Large amounts of resource-constrained embedded systems will connect to a cloud of powerful server computers. We present an optimization technique for lattice-based signature generation on such embedded systems; our goal is to optimize latency rather than throughput. Indeed, on an embedded system, the latency of a single signature for user identification or message authentication is more important than the aggregate signature generation rate. We builda high-performance implementation using hardware/software codesign techniques. The key idea is to partition the signature generation scheme into offline and online phases. The signature scheme allows this separation because a large portion of the computation does not depend on the message to be signed and can be handled before the message is given. Then, we can map complex precomputation operations in software on a low-cost processor and utilize hardware resources to accelerate simpler online operations. To find the optimum hardware architecture for the target platform, we define and explore the design space and implement two design configurations. We realize our solutions on the Altera Cyclone-IV CGX150 FPGA. The implementation consists of a NIOS soft-core processor and a low-latency hash and polynomial multiplication engine. On average, the proposed low-latency architecture can generate a signature with a latency of 96 clock cycles at 40MHz, resulting in a response time of 2.4μs for a signing request. On equivalent platforms, this corresponds to a performance improvement of 33 and 105 times compared to previous hardware and software implementations, respectively. © 2015 ACM.",,10.1145/2724714,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929154385&doi=10.1145%2f2724714&partnerID=40&md5=77aae8a1fc916c95142f7dd043c1b031,Article

However, almost all popular signature schemes are either based on the factoring assumption (RSA) or the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem (DSA/ECDSA). In the case of classical cryptanalytic advances or progress on the development of quantum computers, the hardness of these closely related problems might be seriously weakened. A potential alternative approach is the construction of signature schemes based on the hardness of certain lattice problems that are assumed to be intractable by quantum computers. Due to significant research advancements in recent years, lattice-based schemes have now become practical and appear to be a very viable alternative to number-theoretic cryptography. In this article, we focus on recent developments and the current state of the art in lattice-based digital signatures and provide a comprehensive survey discussing signature schemes with respect to practicality.

The MRF models represent the experiments as graphs of discrete events over space-time. This paper extends the MRF approach to continuous time, by defining a new class of realistic model, the stochastic path model, and showing how it can be applied to ideal polaroid type polarizers in such experiments. The final section discusses possibilities for future research, ranging from uses in other experiments or novel quantum communication systems, to extensions involving stochastic paths in the space of functions over continuous space. As part of this, it derives a new Boltzmann-like density operator over Fock space, which predicts the emergent statistical equilibria of nonlinear Hamiltonian field theories, based on our previous work of extending the Glauber-Sudarshan P mapping from the case of classical systems described by a complex state variable α to the case of classical continuous fields.

Because of the close relationship between inhibition and catalysis, understanding the recognition and turnover of enzymatic substrates is essential for rational drug design. Although the Staphylococcus aureus enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (saFabI) involved in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis constitutes a very promising target for the development of novel, urgently needed anti-staphylococcal agents, the substrate binding mode and catalytic mechanism remained unclear for this enzyme. Using a combined crystallographic, kinetic, and computational approach, we have explored the chemical properties of the saFabI binding cavity, obtaining a consistent mechanistic model for substrate binding and turnover. We identified a water-molecule network linking the active site with a water basin inside the homo-tetrameric protein, which seems to be crucial for the closure of the flexible substrate binding loop as well as for an effective hydride and proton transfer during catalysis.

Novelties in this research are security keys of which QC is being utilized in RFID network with continuous key updates. To establish future security around RFID networks, efficient KM protocol and QC, which deal with quantum mathematical procedures and quantum physics, should be analyzed without affecting the legacy. Computational complexities in KM are increasing with the large key sizes, which are manageable through QC. To maximize the security and minimize the complexity in KM, QC with Grover's algorithm is introduced as a method in RFID network environments.

1791,Scopus,Gerber et al. (2015),2015,Computational studies of atmospherically-relevant chemical reactions in water clusters and on liquid water and ice surfaces,Accounts of Chemical Research,"ConspectusReactions on water and ice surfaces and in other aqueous media are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, but the microscopic mechanisms of most of these processes are as yet unknown. This Account examines recent progress in atomistic simulations of such reactions and the insights provided into mechanisms and interpretation of experiments. Illustrative examples are discussed. The main computational approaches employed are classical trajectory simulations using interaction potentials derived from quantum chemical methods. This comprises both ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and semiempirical molecular dynamics (SEMD), the latter referring to semiempirical quantum chemical methods.Presented examples are as follows: (i) Reaction of the (NO+)(NO3-) ion pair with a water cluster to produce the atmospherically important HONO and HNO3. The simulations show that a cluster with four water molecules describes the reaction. This provides a hydrogen-bonding network supporting the transition state. The reaction is triggered by thermal structural fluctuations, and ultrafast changes in atomic partial charges play a key role. This is an example where a reaction in a small cluster can provide a model for a corresponding bulk process. The results support the proposed mechanism for production of HONO by hydrolysis of NO2 (N2O4). (ii) The reactions of gaseous HCl with N2O4 and N2O5 on liquid water surfaces. Ionization of HCl at the water/air interface is followed by nucleophilic attack of Cl- on N2O4 or N2O5. Both reactions proceed by an SN2 mechanism. The products are ClNO and ClNO2, precursors of atmospheric atomic chlorine. Because this mechanism cannot result from a cluster too small for HCl ionization, an extended water film model was simulated. The results explain ClNO formation experiments. Predicted ClNO2 formation is less efficient. (iii) Ionization of acids at ice surfaces. No ionization is found on ideal crystalline surfaces, but the process is efficient on isolated defects where it involves formation of H3O+-acid anion contact ion pairs. This behavior is found in simulations of a model of the ice quasi-liquid layer corresponding to large defect concentrations in crystalline ice. The results are in accord with experiments. (iv) Ionization of acids on wet quartz. A monolayer of water on hydroxylated silica is ordered even at room temperature, but the surface lattice constant differs significantly from that of crystalline ice. The ionization processes of HCl and H2SO4 are of high yield and occur in a few picoseconds. The results are in accord with experimental spectroscopy. (v) Photochemical reactions on water and ice. These simulations require excited state quantum chemical methods. The electronic absorption spectrum of methyl hydroperoxide adsorbed on a large ice cluster is strongly blue-shifted relative to the isolated molecule. The measured and calculated adsorption band low-frequency tails are in agreement. A simple model of photodynamics assumes prompt electronic relaxation of the excited peroxide due to the ice surface. SEMD simulations support this, with the important finding that the photochemistry takes place mainly on the ground state.In conclusion, dynamics simulations using quantum chemical potentials are a useful tool in atmospheric chemistry of water media, capable of comparison with experiment. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/ar500431g,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923096120&doi=10.1021%2far500431g&partnerID=40&md5=3d2dd0c1f79d771586745b0ea0509669,Article

The device demonstrates deep UV free exciton electroluminescence at 362.5 nm. The dominant emission, detectable at ultralow (<1 μA) forward current, does not exhibit any shifts when the forward current is increased. External quantum efficiency (EQE) as high as 0.9% is achieved at 25 μA current at room temperature. Experiments and simulation analysis show that devices fabricated with thinner Ag NWs have higher EQE. However, for very thin Ag NWs (diameter < 250 nm), this trend breaks down due to heat accumulation in the NWs.

The nondimensionalized equations of motion of our turbine are expressed as a star network of N Lorenz subsystems, referred to as augmented Lorenz equations. Here, we propose an application of the augmented Lorenz equations to chaotic cryptography, as a type of symmetric secret-key cryptographic method, wherein message encryption is performed by superimposing the chaotic signal generated from the equations on a plaintext in much the same way as in one-time pad cryptography. The ciphertext is decrypted by unmasking the chaotic signal precisely reproduced with a secret key consisting of 2N-1 (e.g., N=101) real numbers that specify the augmented Lorenz equations. The transmitter and receiver are assumed to be connected via both a quantum communication channel on which the secret key is distributed using a quantum key distribution protocol and a classical data communication channel on which the ciphertext is transmitted.

Obviously, the data recorded in BANs such as vital parameters are personal and should be private. To protect this privacy, such data are usually encrypted when transmitting it over a wireless link. In the past, many cryptographic algorithms and methods for the encryption and decryption of data have been proposed - and most of them have become obsolete. One-time pads (OTPs) were mathematically proven to be secure and impossible to crack. But, for most purposes, OTPs are complicated to handle, because if applied correctly, for each bit of plain text data, another bit of OTP must be available. Sensors in BANs usually do not generate an enormous amount of data. Hence, also the length of an OTP is not huge. Sustained progress in memory technology makes large amounts of nonvolatile memory available at cheap prices and small sizes. Thus, numerous OTPs can be preinstalled on BAN devices and ensure a long lasting and secure data transmission. In this paper, we present a concept for securing data transmission in BANs by utilizing OTPs. We delineate a system for generation, distribution, and utilization of OTPs in wireless sensor network (WSN) and BAN scenarios, and we show the implementation and evaluation of such a system. © 2014 IEEE.",,10.1109/JIOT.2014.2378783,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961813400&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2014.2378783&partnerID=40&md5=206b9c27f685af066fbe2115f67f5ea2,Article

Recently, the first theoretical work of Fröwis and Dür (Phys. Rev. Lett., 106 (2011) 110402) and the first experiment of Lu et al. (Nat. Photon., 8 (2014) 364) both showed that, a new type of Schrödinger's Cat state, the logic-qubit entanglement (concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state) is immune and robust to the noise, and is possible to be applied in future large-scale quantum networks. In this paper, we describe a protocol of entanglement analysis for this kind of Schrödinger's Cat state. Both the Bell-state type of logic-qubit entanglement and multipartite C-GHZ state can be completely distinguished. Based on the entanglement analysis, an arbitrary unknown macroscopic Schrödinger's Cat superposed state can be teleportated and we can also perform the macroscopic entanglement swapping. Our protocol shows that it is possible to realize long-distance quantum communication and large-scale quantum network based on logic-qubit entanglement. © CopyrightEPLA, 2015.",,10.1209/0295-5075/109/40009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924859621&doi=10.1209%2f0295-5075%2f109%2f40009&partnerID=40&md5=ca18de6e89239f20d008117cbcc89d1c,Article

1797,Scopus,Meijer (2015),2015,The universe as a cyclic organized information system: John wheeler’s world revisited,NeuroQuantology,"This essay highlights the scientific vision of John Archibald Wheeler, a giant of 20th century physics. His ideas provided the important insight that humanity may be in the very center of disclosure and manifestation of the evolution of our universe. This on the basis of scientific reasoning derived from quantum physics rather than simple anthropocentrism or scale chauvinism. Wheeler, the Joseph Henry Professor of Physics Emeritus at Princeton University, became 96. Over a long, productive scientific life, he was known for his drive to address big, overarching questions in physics, subjects which he liked to be merged with philosophical questions about the origin of matter, information and the universe. His interests ranged far and wide and were characterized by true fearlessness. Wheeler's work was not only in gravity and nuclear physics. In the 1950s Wheeler grew increasingly intrigued by the philosophical implications of quantum physics. According to Wheeler, there was no universe until the rise of consciousness to perceive it. In fact, Wheeler was one of the first prominent physicists seriously to propose that reality might not be a wholly physical phenomenon. In some sense, Wheeler suggested, reality grows out of the act of observation, and thus consciousness itself: it is “participatory.” He also stated that information is the most fundamental building block of reality, and that the universe should be seen as a selfsynthesized information system: a self-excited circuit that is developing through a (closed loop) cycle. His cosmic variant of the delayed choice experiment led to the idea that human observers may not only determine the present, but also may influence the past. According to Wheeler, ultimate mutability is the central feature of physics, and the meaning of reality can only be established if there is a universal knowledge field, that transcends physical past, present and future. © 2015, NeuroQuantology.

(2015),2015,Phase diagram of fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions in multicomponent systems,Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics,"While the integer quantum Hall effect of composite fermions manifests as the prominent fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) of electrons, the FQHE of composite fermions produces further, more delicate states, arising from a weak residual interaction between composite fermions. We study the spin phase diagram of these states, motivated by the recent experimental observation by Liu and co-workers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 246803 (2014)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.113.246803 and private communication] of several spin-polarization transitions at 4/5, 5/7, 6/5, 9/7, 7/9, 8/11, and 10/13 in GaAs systems. We show that the FQHE of composite fermions is much more prevalent in multicomponent systems, and consider the feasibility of such states for systems with N components for an SU(N) symmetric interaction. Our results apply to GaAs quantum wells, wherein electrons have two components, to AlAs quantum wells and graphene, wherein electrons have four components (two spins and two valleys), and to an H-terminated Si(111) surface, which can have six components. The aim of this paper is to provide a fairly comprehensive list of possible incompressible fractional quantum Hall states of composite fermions, their SU(N) spin content, their energies, and their phase diagram as a function of the generalized ""Zeeman"" energy. We obtain results at three levels of approximation: from ground-state wave functions of the composite fermion theory, from composite fermion diagonalization, and, whenever possible, from exact diagonalization. Effects of finite quantum well thickness and Landau-level mixing are neglected in this study. We compare our theoretical results with the experiments of Liu and co-workers [Phys. Rev.

1802,Scopus,Panwar et al. (2015),2015,"Many paths to sustainability, but where are we going?","Forests, Business and Sustainability","The scholar and social philosopher, James Carse, once remarked that “the mind does not come to life until it meets something it cannot comprehend.” And that moment has arrived in the global forest sector. Saving the world’s forests is one of the grand challenges facing humankind (Howard-Grenville et al., 2014). The timeframe within which to address this challenge before irreparable damage is done to the world’s most diverse ecosystems is narrow. Ironically, those seeking to solve the problem are oftentimes the ones causing it. To make matters worse, there is no central authority dealing with the problem. Sustainability of the world’s forests, then, by deﬁnition (Levin et al., 2012), is truly a “wicked” problem. While many philosophical approaches to address wicked problems seem enlightening, each remains a victim of its narrow paradigm – making stakeholder convergence a nightmare. Many solutions seem promising, yet each is restricted in scope and impact – making success a daydream. Baﬄed interest groups then begin to project the problem in their own ways, some by showcasing an inconvenient truth, others by constructing a convenient lie. As a result, targets become elusive, or worse even, illusive. Numerous initiatives – both substantive and symbolic – spring up from diﬀerent directions. A wicked problem is thus accompanied by a multitude of proposed solutions, creating a vertigo-like situation. It is against this backdrop that we view the numerous sustainability initia-tives that permeate the forest sector. In the meantime, myriad forces are causing fundamental changes in the operational environments of the forest sector, as individual enterprises clamor to compete in the increasingly dizzying globalized markets of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Reactions to these forces have resulted in the emergence of business models that not only must take sustainability into account, but must also allow for the pursuit of wealth creation through competitive advantage. We appear to be in the midst of a “sustainability vertigo,” caught betwixt bewilderment that would puzzle even the most seasoned academics and exhilaration over the potential that forestry holds for aﬀecting positive change. Our primary motivation for this book is to help disentangle these per-plexing issues and to help our readers to unpack the various strands of sustainability-oriented initiatives occurring in the forest sector. In so doing, this book draws on the expertise of globally renowned scholars that not only provide state-of-the-art knowledge on matters related to sustainability in the forest sector, but also critically assess the eﬃcacy of a number of widespread sustainability initiatives. The book is organized as follows. The book begins by sketching out broad case for why we should care about the sustainability of global forests. In their chapter, “The spectrum of forest usage: From livelihood support to large scale commercialization,” Kathryn Fernholz and Jim Bowyer take a functionalist view and argue, through data and anecdotes, that forests are indispensable to human well-being. They take a reader back to a time when forests were primary sources of food and fuel, and traverse into the modern era when – as we write this chapter – news comes of computer chips made of wood-based materials. The authors present, in a simple-to-understand manner, an excellent example of an institutional paradox (Thornton and Ocasio, 2008) that, on one hand, attributes human dependence on forest resources as a concern for sustainability, and, on the other, promotes increased uses of renewable forest resources as a means of addressing the sustainability challenge. Paradoxes aside, Fernholz and Bowyer also provide an excellent backdrop for Constance McDermott to delve into the oft-ignored topic of our collective human footprint on forests in her chapter on regulatory and policy interventions for achieving sustainability. The issue of our human footprint has previously been raised on a global scale, most notably by Wackernagel and Rees (1996), and, more speciﬁcally, for the forest sector (Kozak, 2014). In both of these works, clarion calls for a check on consumption are made and the notion of a conservation-based economy is emphasized, yet the topic – for a variety of reasons – has not yet gained traction among sustainability scholars. In this light, McDermott’s chapter is a persuasive reminder to the academic community that it is high time that the quest for sustainability confronts some diﬃcult and inconvenient questions. This chapter presents a dense and comprehensive overview of the various governmental and stakeholder-driven policy initiatives, viewing them, on balance, as being fairly successful in helping to achieve sustainability. This somewhat optimistic view of regulatory initiatives looks much more promising when juxtaposed with what Benjamin Cashore, Chris Elliott, Erica Pohnan, Michael Stone and Sébastien Jodoin have to say about the eﬃcacy of market mechanisms in achieving sustainability: “[market mechanisms] … seem poorly designed to fully address urgent issues such as the climate crisis and deforestation.” For instance, forest certiﬁcation was originally envisioned as a positive mechanism for sustainability of tropical forests, and in the past two decades, an enormous area of global forests has been third-party certiﬁed. Inevitably, the outside reviews of forest management practices have shown arguably incremental, management improvements. However, much of the world’s tropical forests still remain largely outside the purview of forest certiﬁcation despite the reassuring presence this can have in key global markets. Can forest certiﬁcation as one emerging response then be described as a success? In their chapter entitled, “Achieving sustainability through market mechanisms,” Cashore, Elliott, Pohnan, Stone and Jodoin explore these sorts of questions in more detail, focusing on the role of market forces in impacting forest sustainability. In so doing, they proﬁle two key market forces in addition to forest certiﬁcation, reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) and legality veriﬁcation. The authors propose numerous ways in which market mechanisms could be strengthened to live up to their expectations, and by using four dimensions of market instruments and four pathways of inﬂuence, they describe conditions where market mechanisms can play a more prominent role in sustainable forestry. The chapter on market mechanisms leads up to what has recently become the “holy grail” of sustainability initiatives across industries – corporate responsibility (CR). In their critical commentary, “On corporate responsibility,” Anne Toppinen, Katja Lähtinen and Jani Holopainen ﬁrst paint a broad theoretical canvas within which they situate ongoing CR practices in the forest sector. The chapter, broad in scope, rich in content, and balanced in judgement, calls for industry champions to catalyze forest sector companies in taking a leap – a quantum leap – from their entrenched conservative approaches and somewhat tainted past (where environmental issues are concerned) toward a resplendent future wherein they are proactive in addressing social and environmental concerns. In order for this future to unfold, the authors identify two major interventions: the development of a culture that is conducive to the implementation of CR practices and the integration of CR within broader strategic communications initiatives. In closing, the authors raise the issue of institutional factors required for making CR a success, perhaps reminding readers of the classic question of whether corporations can ever be responsible, or are they, by design, inherently wicked (Dunn, 1991)? While it is beyond the scope of this book to address this question head-on, we do turn our attention to alternative forms of organization, land tenure reform and the emergence of new business models that many argue are central to the sustainability discourse in the forest sector. In the ﬁrst of three chapters on this topic, Alexandre Corriveau-Bourque, Jenny Springer, Andy White and D. Bryson Ogden tackle the increasingly dynamic and highly political issue of forest tenure reform with an overview and treatise on the importance of recognizing community forest rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The authors take a close look at how the ownership of the world’s forests has changed in the past decade, and what implications this has had for local peoples, enterprises, governments, civil society and investors. Underlined by the fact that there, “is a growing base of evidence that demonstrates that local rights to land and forest resources are essential for the meaningful achievement of economic development, conservation, and climate change mitigation goals,” the authors oﬀer an account of how Indigenous Peoples and other communities have successfully asserted their rights and increased their share of legal forest ownership of the world’s forests, but caution readers that many claims to forests by local peoples remain contested and unresolved, with recent evidence suggesting a slowdown in the restitution of forest rights. In the ﬁnal analysis, they put forward several logical and cogent policy-based arguments for local forest communities to continue down this decentralization path as a means of ensuring their sustainability and the sustainability of the forests upon which they depend. Central to these questions on decentralization and forest tenure reform is the notion that these must go hand-in-hand with the creation of enabling environments which support the creation of viable small-scale enterprises and meaningful employment opportunities, especially in developing economies. The complexion of forest-based businesses is rapidly changing, and large multinationals – which have tended to dominate the forestry dialogue – are becoming increasingly inconsequential in a context of decentralization. In their chapter on “Enabling investment for locally controlled forestry,” Duncan Macqueen and Peter deMarsh look at this question in more detail, from the point of view of investments in smaller-scale forestry operations, including community forest initiatives, smallholdings and small and medium enterprises. Opportunities for the creation of sustainable small-scale forestbased enterprises are virtually limitless, and ﬂourishing examples abound from around the world. However, the success of locally controlled forestry is not without formidable challenges, not the least of which include a lack of market access to conventional markets, constrained access to capital, high transaction costs, and limited high-quality employment opportunities. The authors argue that investment is central to the success of locally controlled forestry and, ultimately, the long-term sustainability of forest resources; to that end, the chapter enumerates a number of practicable ways in which investment funds can be attracted. In addition, they oﬀer up four recommendations on how enabling environments can be promulgated to increase the likelihood of success of locally controlled forestry and more meaningfully contribute to the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. In their chapter on “Decentralization and community-based approaches, Reem Hajjar and Augusta Molnar drill down even further on this topic with a summary of one of the most interesting and signiﬁcant trends in the forest sector today. Decentralization – the process of national governments ceding powers to lower levels – is becoming increasingly commonplace in the forestry sector, typically manifested in the creation and management of community forests and community forest enterprises. While community-based approaches have had mixed results, they have certainly garnered much attention from civil society, policy makers and academics as a means of generating long-term economic, social and environmental beneﬁts for vested communities. In this chapter, the authors – through a number of real-world examples – discuss the recent growth of decentralized models as alternative forms of tenure, provide a backdrop for why this trend is taking place, examine why it is that some community-based approaches succeed while others fail, and decisively show how such approaches can and do contribute to forest sector sustainability. Up to this point, a recurring theme in this book is that “win-win” solutions are possible. A faith in this thesis – desirable as it may be – can only bring us so far. Management scholars are now beginning to see the naivety of a simplistic win-win view, and are instead focusing on the tensions that emerge on a path to sustainability (Hahn et al., 2014). Jacki Schirmer, Romain Pirard and Peter Kanowski meticulously present those tensions in the context of plantation forestry in their aptly titled chapter, “Promises and perils of plantation forestry.” Originally conceived to meet human ﬁber needs through planted forests and relieve pressure from pristine, ecologically valuable forests, plantation forests come with mixed baggage. Plantations currently provide about one-third of global industrial wood supply, yet that proportion remains much smaller than that supplied by natural forests. The authors present a cogent picture of the industrial forest plantation narrative and, in so doing, highlight the complexities inherent in expansionist interventions and “techno-ﬁxes” to solve complex, multifaceted sustainability problems. This trend has done little to alleviate environmental concerns within society regarding forest sector activities. Instead, the concerns have simply shifted from issues such as clearcutting and the harvesting of old-growth to issues like monocultures, loss of biodiversity, water consumption, and, perhaps most critically, the impact of large plantations on local peoples. And yet, a genuinely sustainable business model remains an aspiration for the forest sector, and the plantation approach may mean improved competitiveness for many multinational forestry ﬁrms. With that paradox in mind, the authors call for a more sophisticated discussion of the merits of various models of plantation forestry and caution us about the danger of focusing only on the problems of the plantation approach. © 2016 Rajat Panwar, Robert Kozak and Eric Hansen, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.",,10.4324/9781315771397-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046655831&doi=10.4324%2f9781315771397-8&partnerID=40&md5=e4e7d1e03ca06a49e7a2fd0eb48e0689,Book Chapter

The ability to see connections with data and relate it to trends analysis is a key aspect in utilizing Big Data. Coupled with the rise of Big Data is also the development of faster computing systems which can collate and summarize data queries initiated by the enduser. The age of quantum computers whereby searching techniques will be accelerated beyond current abilities of the processing speeds of traditional digital processors will necessitate different ways to display information and analyze it. Natural language and semantic search strategies, search engine advancements and AI developments are introducing newer approaches to data analysis. By using both search techniques formulated by humans and combining them with results obtained from machine assisted learning a new era of information access has evolved. Finding information using newer cognitive based modeling systems to help retrieve information as well as understanding the growth of data will be outlined. Visual demonstrations of new information modeling systems will be discussed and the implications of accessing data for the eventual solutions to complex problems will also be discussed. The rate of change in knowledge accumulation necessitates that search strategies be fluid and generative in their design rather than static or sequential. Knowledge management also needs to be integrated with a dynamic structure with search strategy designs, which can constantly utilize newer forms of data analysis. The preparation and planning for installing a progressive knowledge based management and acquisition system in educational institutions needs to be deployed sooner rather than later so as to better prepare the next generation of Thai students entering the newly formed ASAEN community. In order for these new skills to be developed a new form of pedagogy needs to be implemented in all educational institutions from K-16 so human capital can be relevant and capable of understanding the growth of big data and its application to society.",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994338569&partnerID=40&md5=1a90a17aced529d8736f6bcd08240aab,Conference Paper

(2015),2015,"Indian Space - Towards a ""national eco-system"" for future Space activities","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","The vision of Indian Space was enunciated (in early 1970) by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai - who envisioned the development of Indian space capability for benefit to society and meeting national development goals. The programme is founded on self-reliance and indigenous capability development. Indian space activities have made tremendous progress in the past 50 years with successful satellites that have contributed to national development, science endeavor and technological capability. Indian communication satellites in INSAT; Indian EO satellites in IRS; Indian positioning satellites in IRNSS; various science missions; Indian launch vehicles in the PSLV and GSLV; mission to Moon - Chandrayaan-1; a mission to Mars have paved the way for advanced successful development of space capability in India. Successful foray into global markets have also been achieved. All this has enabled a high-class end-to-end systemic capability of design, development and operations of Indian space assets and applications. Space based services have created a huge and growing user base - which is a unique opportunity for developing space industry and creating high technology jobs. Changing policy environment in India - favoring deregulation; investments and thrusted privatization; impetus to manufacturing; intensive co-operation etc are generating a strong market drive for space activities in India. Indian space needs to orient for a quantum jump in technological growth, adopt organisational models that will ensure economic efficiency and position a vibrant private sector. National consequences for Indian human space-flight and planetary exploration programme; quest for a larger share and role in global space market; strategies to deal with changing political and economic environments and focused imperatives of international cooperation need strategic focus. National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) has taken up a policy-research study to determine a futuristic Indian Space Policy - a comprehensive ""Indian Space Policy"" which addresses the long-term strategy of Indian space and promotes a holistic Indian Space enterprise - alignment to national goals of industrialization and development; evolving a vibrant eco-system of government-private sector partnership that assures operational space services (communications, EO and navigation etc) and advanced technology development; national commitment for Mong-term' human spaceflight and planetary exploration mission investments and a strategic international cooperation regime. NIAS has undertaken wide consultation with Indian space professionals and is organising a National Space Policy Workshop - all of which will be assimilated into the Policy document.

(2015),2015,Enhancement of single-photon sources with metamaterials,From Atomic to Mesoscale: The Role of Quantum Coherence in Systems of Various Complexities,"Scientists are looking for new, breakthrough solutions that can greatly advance computing and networking systems. These solutions will involve quantum properties of matter and light as promised by the ongoing experimental and theoretical work in the areas of quantum computation and communication. Quantum photonics is destined to play a central role in the development of such technologies due to the high transmission capacity and outstanding low-noise properties of photonic information channels. Among the vital problems to be solved in this direction, are efficient generation and collection of single photons. One approach to tackle these problems is based on engineering emission properties of available single-photon sources using metamaterials. Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures with sub-wavelength features whose optical properties go beyond the limitations of conventional materials. As promising single-photon sources, we have chosen nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, which are capable to operate stably in a single-photon regime at room temperature in a solid state environment. In this chapter, we report both theoretical and experimental studies of the radiation from a nanodiamond single NV center placed near a hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM). In particular, we derive the reduction of excited-state lifetime and the enhancement of collected single-photon emission rate and compare them with the experimental observations. These results could be of great impact for future integrated quantum sources, especially owing to a CMOS-compatible approach to HMM synthesis. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

The Army Research Laboratory in Adelphi MD has funded the development of a metamaterial 250-505 MHZ antenna with a λ20 thickness. Kymeta had demonstrated December 2013 the transmission to satellites and back using 20 and 30 GHz antennas about the size of a laptop which use metamaterial resonators to effect the phase shifting. Lincoln Laboratory increases spurious free dynamic range of receiver plus A/D by 40 dB. The possibility of the transmission of electrical and optical signals over the same wire has been demonstrated. Also being investigated is use of IR beams in a Si chip, which is transparent to IR, for transmission of signals without ohmic loss and at the speed of light.

This demand pushes products developments towards constant innovations on detectors, read-out circuits, proximity electronics boards, and coolers. Sofradir was first to show a 10μm focal plane array (FPA) at DSS 2012, and announced the DAPHNIS 10μm product line back in 2014. This pixel pitch is a key enabler for infrared detectors with increased resolution. Sofradir recently achieved outstanding products demonstrations at this pixel pitch, which clearly demonstrate the benefits of adopting 10μm pixel pitch focal plane array-based detectors. Both HD and XGA Daphnis 10μm products also benefit from a global video datapath efficiency improvement by transitioning to digital video interfaces. Moreover, innovative smart pixels functionalities drastically increase product versatility.

To assist the surveillance system operator and automatic image processing tasks, fusing images in IR band is proposed as a solution to increase situational awareness and different fusion techniques are developed for this purpose. Proposed techniques are generally developed for specific scenarios because image content may vary dramatically depending on the spectral range, the optical properties of the cameras, the spectral characteristics of the scene, and the spatial resolution of the interested targets in the scene. A general purpose IR image fusion technique that is suitable for real-time applications is proposed. The proposed technique can support different scenarios by applying a multiscale detail detection and can be applied to images captured from different spectral regions of the spectrum by adaptively adjusting the contrast direction through cross checking between the source images. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on registered multi-spectral and multi-focus IR images. Fusion results are presented and the performance of the proposed technique is compared with the baseline fusion methods through objective and subjective tests. The technique outperforms baseline methods in the subjective tests and provide promising results in objective quality metrics with an acceptable computational load.

Indeed, recent studies on side-channel attacks have exposed the vulnerabilities of QKD implementations against an eavesdropper who may try to attack both the source and the measurement device. Here, we review two potential approaches that, combined, could bring this goal closer: measurement-device-independent QKD and the loss-tolerant QKD protocol. The former removes all possible side-channels from the measurement apparatus and guarantees a high performance over long distances. The latter appears as a robust solution against typical source flaws and it offers similar key rates as those of standard QKD systems.

In particular, we study the question of realizing cut-and-choose oblivious transfer and its variants in the OT-hybrid model. Towards this, we provide new definitions of cut-and-choose oblivious transfer (and its variants) that suffice for its application in cut-and-choose techniques for garbled circuit based two-party protocols. Furthermore, our definitions conceptually simplify previous definitions including those proposed by Lindell (Crypto 2013), Huang et al., (Crypto 2014), and Lindell and Riva (Crypto 2014). Our main result is an efficient realization (under our new definitions) of cut-and-choose OT and its variants with small concrete communication overhead in an OT-hybrid model. Among other things this implies that we can base cut-and-choose OT and its variants under a variety of assumptions, including those that are believed to be resilient to quantum attacks. By contrast, previous constructions of cut-and-choose OT and its variants relied on DDH and could not take advantage of OT extension. Also, our new definitions lead us to more efficient constructions for multistage cut-and-choose OT—a variant proposed by Huang et al.

(2015),2015,Secure satellite communication using multi-photon tolerant quantum communication protocol,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"This paper proposes and analyzes the potential of a multi-photon tolerant quantum communication protocol to secure satellite communication. For securing satellite communication, quantum cryptography is the only known unconditionally secure method. A number of recent experiments have shown feasibility of satellite-Aided global quantum key distribution (QKD) using different methods such as: Use of entangled photon pairs, decoy state methods, and entanglement swapping. The use of single photon in these methods restricts the distance and speed over which quantum cryptography can be applied. Contemporary quantum cryptography protocols like the BB84 and its variants suffer from the limitation of reaching the distances of only Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at the data rates of few kilobits per second. This makes it impossible to develop a general satellite-based secure global communication network using the existing protocols. The method proposed in this paper allows secure communication at the heights of the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. The benefits of the proposed method are two-fold: First it enables the realization of a secure global communication network based on satellites and second it provides unconditional security for satellite networks at GEO heights. The multi-photon approach discussed in this paper ameliorates the distance and speed issues associated with quantum cryptography through the use of contemporary laser communication (lasercom) devices. This approach can be seen as a step ahead towards global quantum communication. © 2015 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2188575,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960926364&doi=10.1117%2f12.2188575&partnerID=40&md5=f77807cbad8d9ae3ddfcf947d74a3590,Conference Paper

(2015),2015,TRIZ and the paradigms of social sustainability in product development endeavors,Procedia Engineering,"The Business practices of an industrialized civilization are responsible for intensifying the dynamics of the interdependent environmental, social and economic domains of our ecosystem. The worldwide objective to accomplish Sustainability is invariably addressed by Policy makers and Institutions by means of moderately disparate co-relations between Environmental and Social considerations. The dimension of Social Sustainability has a direct co-relation towards the extended continuation of a globalized Enterprise. The stated co-relation is an interconnected and interdependent network comprising of growth in Innovation and Sustainability at the Environmental and Economic frontiers. From the standpoint of Innovation, the 20th century has been dominated by both TRIZ with OTSM and Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns to steer the future of revolutionary innovations. Moreover, TRIZ and its evolved counterpart OTSM have been extensively utilized for macroscale problem solving scenarios, while Kurzweil's Law has reached up to quantum scale whereby matter as we know exhibits an entire range of unique properties with a potential to dramatically transform our human civilization. Accordingly, the perceived limitations and vague applicability of TRIZ in sub-macro scale innovations has been discussed. The contemporary tools for project evaluation (e.g.: cost benefit analysis) and product development (e.g.: linear stage-gate process) quintessential for commercializing innovations are identified to be limited, both in scope and accuracy for delivering a long term 'sustainable' competitive advantage to an Enterprise. Consequently, the proposed conceptual Multifaceted Framework addresses the issue of social sustainability in Product Development. The underpinnings of Systems Thinking, TRIZ and OTSM, Complex Adaptive Systems, Socio-Economics & Human Behavior forms the fundamental basis of the proposed Multifaceted Framework. The novel perspective offered by the proposed Framework enables product development teams to overcome the inherent myopia and other limitations associated with the contemporary Environmental Life Cycle Analysis and Sustainability related Decision Models. An Expert opinion based evaluation technique in conjugation with a Multilayered Decision Modeling Method have been incorporated as a salient features in the proposed framework. The evaluation technique is utilized for assigning numerical values to the pertinent sustainability related criteria of the Multilayered Decision Model. The proposed Framework plays a crucial role in product development and decision modeling across the Idea Screening Phase (Stage 2) up to the Feasibility Analysis Phase (Stage 4). In addition, a modified version Taguchi Loss Function is included to exemplify a tangible relation between Product Quality parameters and Sustainability. The objective of the proposed framework is to provide an efficient, yet comprehensive evaluation as well as an effective product development strategy with a distinct and a holistic outlook on Social Sustainability. © 2015 The Authors.

(2015),2015,Structural and optical properties of silicon nanocrystals embedded in silicon carbide: Comparison of single layers and multilayer structures,Applied Surface Science,"The outstanding demonstration of quantum confinement in Si nanocrystals (Si NC) in a SiC matrix requires the fabrication of Si NC with a narrow size distribution. It is understood without controversy that this fabrication is a difficult exercise and that a multilayer (ML) structure is suitable for such fabrication only in a narrow parameter range. This parameter range is sought by varying both the stoichiometric SiC barrier thickness and the Si-rich SiC well thickness between 3 and 9nm and comparing them to single layers (SL). The samples processed for this investigation were deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and subsequently subjected to thermal annealing at 1000-1100°C for crystal formation. Bulk information about the entire sample area and depth were obtained by structural and optical characterization methods: information about the mean Si NC size was determined from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to gain insight into the structure of the Si-C network, and spectrophotometry measurements were performed to investigate the absorption coefficient and to estimate the bandgap E 04 . All measurements showed that the influence of the ML structure on the Si NC size, on the Si-C network and on the absorption properties is subordinate to the influence of the overall Si content in the samples, which we identified as the key parameter for the structural and optical properties. We attribute this behavior to interdiffusion of the barrier and well layers. Because the produced Si NC are within the target size range of 2-4nm for all layer thickness variations, we propose to use the Si content to adjust the Si NC size in future experiments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1821,Scopus,Werbos (2015),2015,Computational intelligence from AI to BI to NI,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"This paper gives highlights of the history of the neural network field, stressing the fundamental ideas which have been in play. Early neural network research was motivated mainly by the goals of artificial intelligence (AI) and of functional neuroscience (biological intelligence, BI), but the field almost died due to frustrations articulated in the famous book Perceptrons by Minsky and Papert. When I found a way to overcome the difficulties by 1974, the community mindset was very resistant to change; it was not until 1987/1988 that the field was reborn in a spectacular way, leading to the organized communities now in place. Even then, it took many more years to establish crossdisciplinary research in the types of mathematical neural networks needed to really understand the kind of intelligence we see in the brain, and to address the most demanding engineering applications. Only through a new (albeit short-lived) funding initiative, funding crossdisciplinary teams of systems engineers and neuroscientists, were we able to fund the critical empirical demonstrations which put our old basic principle of ""deep learning"" firmly on the map in computer science. Progress has rightly been inhibited at times by legitimate concerns about the ""Terminator threat"" and other possible abuses of technology. This year, at SPIE, in the quantum computing track, we outline the next stage ahead of us in breaking out of the box, again and again, and rising to fundamental challenges and opportunities still ahead of us. © 2015 COPYRIGHT SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2191520,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954066975&doi=10.1117%2f12.2191520&partnerID=40&md5=79d87e485e3eb81c0d37018e7bc73f15,Conference Paper

Therefore, nowadays Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) promises a secure key agreement by using quantum mechanical systems. QKD becomes a significant trend of new cryptographic revolution.

1824,Scopus,Sarath & Shajin (2015),2015,Key distribution using dual channel technique for ultimate security,Indian Journal of Science and Technology,"Background: A new approach for the implementation of Quantum Cryptography is proposed in this paper. Quantum Cryptography has practical weakness like lack of authentication, single photon generation and many real time implementation problems. This paper also explains how the drawback of BB84 protocol is eliminated by combining Classical Cryptography and Quantum techniques. Methods: We analyze the usage of Dual Channel Interferometer technique and thereby fusing Quantum techniques with classical technique. And their combination result in the feasibility of authentication, and hacker identification, thereby introducing a novel method of QKD transmission. A quantum digital authentication scheme based on hash function is proposed in this paper .The security of the quantum protocol lies on the existence of quantum one way function by fundamental quantum principle. The practical difficulties in quantum control and quantum computation made quantum protocol hard to implement. The lack of authentication made the quantum protocol vulnerable to hackers. Introducing two level quantum system authentications can be achieved with the help of hash function. To guarantee the authenticity, hash codes are split into two parts and exchange of code is made through two quantum channels. This scheme uses a programmable polarizer ensuring the quantum one way function and removing the practical difficulties of quantum control and quantum computation. The proposed scheme presents a novel method to construct secure quantum authentication for future communication. Result: Dual channel implementation helps in implementing authentication in quantum BB84 protocol. We combined the advantages of quantum techniques and classical techniques and tried to implement a novel technique to ensure secure communication. Application: People use the ATM for transactions such as cash withdrawal, money transfer and payment of electricity and telephone bills. ATM is the most convenient to access the accounts and funding transactions. Personal Identification Number (PIN) is an important aspect of the current ATM system in providing security and it is a commonly used method in protecting the transaction of one's account.By implementing above technique ATM pin transfer can be successfully made.",,10.17485/ijst/2015/v8i26/80999,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949936446&doi=10.17485%2fijst%2f2015%2fv8i26%2f80999&partnerID=40&md5=00c8cdafe454ac965c7d6083527a92e2,Article

1826,Scopus,Bonnier et al. (2015),2015,Aryl-Substituted boron subphthalocyanines and their application in organic photovoltaics,Australian Journal of Chemistry,"A family of five axial aryl-substituted boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) derivatives bearing a hydrido, methyl, methoxy, phenyl, or fluoro substituent at the para position of the aryl were synthesised from Br-BsubPc and the corresponding aryl Grignard reagent in moderate yields. The physicochemical characterisation of these derivatives gave similar absorption, photoluminescence, and cyclic voltammetry profiles and photoluminescence quantum yields, indicating that the nature of the substituent at the para position does not influence the basic photophysical properties of this generic class of BsubPcs. Conversely, the solid-state structural arrangement obtained from single crystals is highly dependent on the para substituent; for the non-polar hydrido, methyl, and phenyl substituents, only concave isoindole π interactions are present. Substitution for the polar methoxy or fluoro ligand affords one-dimensional ribbons formed by convex π interactions, where these ribbons further interact through concave isoindole π interactions with the adjacent ribbon, creating an extended two-dimensional π network. On incorporation of the hydrido, methyl, and fluoro derivatives into organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, similar results and device metrics were obtained with the methyl and fluoro derivatives. Both, however, were significantly outperformed by the hydrido derivative. The uniqueness of the hydrido derivative is only realised once incorporated into OPVs as it shares the same basic physical properties as the other derivatives. Given these findings, we identify the hydrido derivative as the aryl-BsubPc with the most promise for future work in OPVs. © 2015 CSIRO.",,10.1071/CH15381,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946121226&doi=10.1071%2fCH15381&partnerID=40&md5=9b47cc5b7a85526282c75358c10bc0bf,Article

Significant developments in silicon photonic manufacturing and integration are enabling investigations into applications beyond that of traditional telecom: sensing, filtering, signal processing, quantum technology-and even optical computing. In effect, we are now seeing a convergence of communications and computation, where the traditional roles and boundaries of optics and microelectronics are becoming blurred. As the applications for opto-electronic integrated circuits (OEICs) are developed, and manufacturing capabilities expand, design support is necessary to fully exploit the potential of this technology. Photonic design automation represents an opportunity to take OEIC design to a larger scale, facilitating design-space exploration, and laying the foundation for current and future optical applications-thus fully realizing the potential of this technology.

Using a building-block model for optical devices, we provide an EDAinspired design flow and methodologies for optical design automation. Underlying these flows and methodologies are new supporting techniques in behavioral andphysical synthesis. We also provide modeling for optical devices, and determine optimization and constraint parameters that guide the automation techniques.

Since then in the last four and half decades, India has made considerable progress in the development of Space Launch Vehicles. The first development of SatelliteLaunch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3) was initiated in the early 1970s, and in the span of 10 years, it was successfully flown in July 1980 by placing a 40 kg satellite into orbit. This effort helped to understand the intricacies of launch vehicle technologies. Further technology developments in the areas of strap-on booster, bulbous payloadfairing, canted nozzles, closed-loop guidance, and overall mission management were mastered in the next development vehicle, Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) with payload capability of 150 kg. Parallely efforts were on to develop Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching of operational remote sensing satellites into Sun Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO). PSLV provided a quantum jump in the development of several critical technologies like large solid motor, earth-storable liquid engines, composite motor case, strapdown navigation system, etc. This vehicle has multi-mission capability with missions such as Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Sun Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO), and Geo Transfer Orbit (GTO).and also has provision to carry multiple satellites. During the same period ISRO initiated the developmentof Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle(GSLV) with three stages, employing solid, liquid, and cryogenic propulsion modules for launching 2t class of operational communication satellites into GTO. Initially a procured cryogenic stage from Russia was used for the upper stage. At the same time, the technology developments needed for cryo-engine and stage systems were undertaken. The engine was successfully qualified through a series of ground tests, short and long duration at different levels. The cryo-stage is flight tested successfully in January 2014. For launching 4 t class of communication spacecraft the development of GSLV Mk-3 was initiated. It is a threestage vehicle consisting of a large solid propellant booster, liquid stage with clustered engines, a high thrust cryo-engine operating in gas generator cycle, and lightweight composite structures.

This simple device of only a microfiber has the merits of easy coupling, low loss and relatively pure mode to be applied in the fiber network. And microfiber-structure renders the sensor with small size and relatively large nonlinear coefficient. The strain-induced shift of both the signal and idler peaks are large enough to be detected. According to calculated results in this paper, the shift range increases with the decease of the microfiber's diameter and the increase of strain on the fiber until a critical value. We presented the trends in a figure, and found the maximum shift is at 59.51 nm when we adjusted the diameter within strain of 30mε, and the high strain sensitivity of 2 pm/με is achieved when we set the pumping wavelength at 1550nm, peak power at 100 W. This strain sensor has high sensitivity, light and portable performance which has wide applications, such as mechanical detection or fault diagnosis in auto, aircraft, navigation. Moreover, large strain-induced shift could be applies to a number of wavelength selected devices, for example, a tunable laser or a wavelength-tuning entangled photon source which is significant in quantum information process. © 2015 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2193296,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943412449&doi=10.1117%2f12.2193296&partnerID=40&md5=09847bfb935af369f8081b4485b31b19,Conference Paper

The former allows two parties to share secret messages with information-theoretic security, even in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper in the communication channel, which is impossible with classical resources alone. The latter enables two distrustful parties to agree on a random bit, again with information-theoretic security, and with a cheating probability lower than the one that can be reached in a classical scenario. Our implementations rely on continuous-variable technology for quantum key distribution and on a plug and play discrete-variable system for coin flipping, and necessitate a rigorous security analysis adapted to the experimental schemes and their imperfections.

Conventional methods including rainfall-runoff models and statistical techniques usually rely on a number of assumptions, leading to some deviation from the exact results. Artificial neural network (ANN) has the advantages of high fault-tolerance, strong nonlinear mapping and learning ability, which provides an effective method for the daily runoff forecasting. However, its training has certain drawbacks such as time-consuming, slow learning speed and easily falling into local optimum, which cannot be ignored in the real world application. In order to overcome the disadvantages of ANN model, the artificial neural network model based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), ANN-QPSO for short, is presented for the daily runoff forecasting in this paper, where QPSO was employed to select the synaptic weights and thresholds of ANN, while ANN was used for the prediction. The proposed model can combine the advantages of both QPSO and ANN to enhance the generalization performance of the forecasting model. The methodology is assessed by using the daily runoff data of Hongjiadu reservoir in southeast Guizhou province of China from 2006 to 2014.

1838,Scopus,Lin et al. (2015),2015,Nano-scale optical actuation based on two-dimensional heterostructure photonic crystal cavities,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Nowadays, nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) actuators using electrostatic forces are facing the bottleneck of the electromagnetic interference which greatly degrades their performances. On the contrary, the hybrid circuits driven by optical gradient forces which are immune to the electromagnetic interference show prominent advantages in communication, quantum computation, and other application systems. In this paper we propose an optical actuator utilizing the optical gradient force generated by a hetero-structure photonic crystal cavity. This type of cavity has a longitudinal air-slot and characteristics of ultrahigh quality factor (Q) and ultra-small mode volume (V) which is capable of producing a much larger force compared with the waveguide-based structures. Due to the symmetry property, attractive optical gradient force is generated. Additionally, the optomechanical coefficient (gom) of this cavity is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the coupled nanobeam photonic crystal cavities. The 2D hetero-structure cavity, comb drives, folded beam suspensions and the displacement sensor compose the whole device. The cavity serves as the optical actuator whilst the butt-coupled waveguide acts as the displacement sensor which is theoretically proved to be insensitive to the temperature variations. As known, the thermo-optic effect prevails especially in the cavity-based structures. The butt-coupled waveguide can be used to decouple the thermal effect and the optoemchanical effect (OM) with the aid of comb drives. The results demonstrate that the proposed optical gradient force actuator show great potential in the future of all-optical reconfigurable circuits. © 2015 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2078222,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930268568&doi=10.1117%2f12.2078222&partnerID=40&md5=fdf356f3f7aa70d6b49f97412949830c,Conference Paper
1839,Scopus,Sin et al. (2015),2015,Destructive physical analysis of degraded quantum cascade lasers,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Remarkable progress made in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) has led them to find an increasing number of applications in remote sensing, chemical sensing, and free space communications, in addition to potential space applications. However, little has been reported on reliability and failure modes of QCLs although it is crucial to understand failure modes and underlying degradation mechanisms in developing QCLs that meet lifetime requirements for space missions. Focused ion beam (FIB) techniques have been employed to investigate failure modes in various types of laser diodes. Our group has also used FIB to study failure modes in single-mode and multi-mode InGaAs-AlGaAs strained QW lasers, but few groups have used this technique to investigate failure modes in QCLs. In our study, we report on destructive physical analysis (DPA) of degraded InGaAs-InAlAs QCLs using FIB and high-resolution TEM techniques. The active region of QCLs that we studied consisted of two-23 stage layers of InGaAs-InAlAs separated by a 0.5 μm thick InP spacer layer for 8.4μm QCLs and 30-stage layers of lattice-matched InGaAs-InAlAs heterostructure for 4.7μm QCLs. The MOVPE-grown laser structures were fabricated into deep-etched ridge waveguide QCLs. L-I-V-spectral characteristics were measured at RT under pulsed operation. Our 8.4μm QCLs with as-cleaved and HR-coated facets showed a laser threshold of 1.7 A and a threshold voltage of 13 V at RT, whereas our 4.7μm QCLs without facet coating showed threshold currents of 320 - 400 mA and threshold voltages of 13 - 13.5V. Failures were generated via short-term tests of QCLs. FIB systems were used to study the damage area on the front facet and also to prepare TEM cross sections at different locations along the waveguide for defect and chemical analyses using a HR-TEM. In contrast to the COMD damaged area showing as a blister on the front facet of QW lasers, the damaged area of QCLs was significantly extended into the InP substrate due to a much less absorption of lasing photons in QCLs. Our detailed destructive physical analysis results are reported including defect, structural, and chemical analysis results from degraded QCLs. © 2015 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2076641,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930177054&doi=10.1117%2f12.2076641&partnerID=40&md5=a693790723eaddfa7d223afb7f7a2641,Conference Paper

(2015),2015,Monolithic silicon photonics in a sub-100nm SOI CMOS microprocessor foundry: Progress from devices to systems,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"We review recent progress of an effort led by the Stojanović (UC Berkeley), Ram (MIT) and Popović (CU Boulder) research groups to enable the design of photonic devices, and complete on-chip electro-optic systems and interfaces, directly in standard microelectronics CMOS processes in a microprocessor foundry, with no in-foundry process modifications. This approach allows tight and large-scale monolithic integration of silicon photonics with state-of-the-art (sub-100nm-node) microelectronics, here a 45nm SOI CMOS process. It enables natural scale-up to manufacturing, and rapid advances in device design due to process repeatability. The initial driver application was addressing the processor-to-memory communication energy bottleneck. Device results include 5Gbps modulators based on an interleaved junction that take advantage of the high resolution of the sub-100nm CMOS process. We demonstrate operation at 5fJ/bit with 1.5dB insertion loss and 8dB extinction ratio. We also demonstrate the first infrared detectors in a zero-change CMOS process, using absorption in transistor source/drain SiGe stressors. Subsystems described include the first monolithically integrated electronic-photonic transmitter on chip (modulator+driver) with 20-70fJ/bit wall plug energy/bit (2-3.5Gbps), to our knowledge the lowest transmitter energy demonstrated to date. We also demonstrate native-process infrared receivers at 220fJ/bit (5Gbps). These are encouraging signs for the prospects of monolithic electronics-photonics integration. Beyond processor-to-memory interconnects, our approach to photonics as a ""More-than- Moore"" technology inside advanced CMOS promises to enable VLSI electronic-photonic chip platforms tailored to a vast array of emerging applications, from optical and acoustic sensing, high-speed signal processing, RF and optical metrology and clocks, through to analog computation and quantum technology. © 2015 SPIE.",,10.1117/12.2084604,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928796334&doi=10.1117%2f12.2084604&partnerID=40&md5=86c23f87cf20d87e416076f5682d3975,Conference Paper

In this chapter, we introduce the basic theory behind such biphoton pulse shaping and highlight several key experiments conducted in this field. Our emphasis is not only on how entangled photons benefit from these traditionally classical techniques, but also how their specifically quantum properties produce interesting effects not observable with classical fields. We consider both Fourier-transform pulse shaping, which relies on programmable spectral filtering, and electro-optic modulation, in which the temporal phase or amplitude of the biphoton is manipulated by an electrical signal. Both avenues of research have facilitated new insights into biphoton correlations and look to play an important role in the future of quantum state manipulation and the next generation of quantum communication networks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015 All Rights Reserved.",,10.1007/978-3-319-14992-9_13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927930105&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-14992-9_13&partnerID=40&md5=08f480021a5497d4c73f48d368a4e321,Article

(2015),2015,Optical micro/nanofiber as valuable technological platform for lab on fiber,Springer Series in Surface Sciences,"In this Chapter, we introduce optical micro/nanofibers (MNFs) as valuable technological platform for lab on fiber. Starting from the fabrication and micromanipulation of individual MNFs, we put emphases on optical properties and technological applications of MNFs, including both passive components and active devices. A brief outlook regarding future possibilities is also presented. Optical microfibers and nanofibers (MNFs) are optical fibers with diameters close to or smaller than the wavelength of the guided light. A number of names, such as “subwavelength-diameter optical fiber/wire”, “optical microfiber”, “optical nanofiber”, “fiber taper”, “tapered fiber”, “fiber nanowire”, “photonic/optical nanowire”, “submicron-diameter fiber” and “ultrathin fiber”, have been used to mention these one-dimensional (1D) micro/nanoscale waveguides in various literatures. For simplicity, here we use the name “MNF” to cover these tiny optical fibers with diameters from tens of nanometers to several micrometers. When its size goes down to the wavelength of the guided light, an optical MNF exhibits interesting properties such as tight optical confinement, strong near-field interaction, steep field gradient, abnormal dispersion, enhanced surface effects and excellent mechanical flexibilities [1–7], which opens opportunities for combining waveguide optics with near-field optics, nonlinear optics, plasmonics, quantum optics and optomechanics on the nanoscale [8–12], and intrigues a variety of novel nanophotonic components/devices including nanolasers and nanosensors that may serve as a valuable technological platform for Lab on fiber. In this section, we introduce the principles and technological applications of optical nanofibers and nanowires.

With the Department of Defense (DoD) using over two million high-explosive (HE) munitions per year with a significant fraction as UXO, reducing costly range remediation and environmental restoration efforts will offer significant savings. The developed Seismic Acoustic Impact Monitoring Assessment (SAIMA) system is not designed for past ranges, but as a complementary technology to detect, locate within two meters, and classify UXO in near realtime to aid existing cleanup technologies. Feasibility and descriptions of system components have been previously provided (VanDeMark et al., 2009, 2010, 2013). The current system is composed of multiple buried seismic arrays encircling a mortar or artillery impact area, communications from the arrays to a central processing station, and a processing unit that employs an algorithm suite based in the seismology and statistical analysis disciplines to detect, locate, and classify the HE or UXO impact. Recent deployments of the SAIMA system have demonstrated hardware maturity and algorithm refinements to nearly enable the goal of locations within two meters. A field deployment at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, in June 2012 demonstrated acoustic locations at a large range (QTSI, 2012). Subsequent systems tests with five arrays using a synthetic UXO source (kinetic source only; no acoustic phases) on a small field (80 m by 80 m) resolved locations within 0.5 m of ground truth with coverage ellipses at 0.1 m2 (time and azimuth). On a small mortar field, approximately 365 m by 480 m, simulated UXO (inert rounds) were located within an average mislocation distance of 4.1 m and confidence ellipses on the order of 5.8 m by 3.8 m.

First, it aims to develop a system with a highly secured approach to transmitting electronic medical records (EMRs), and second, it aims to identify entities that transmit private patient information without permission. The NTRU and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptosystems are secured encryption methods. The AES is a tested technology that has already been utilized in several systems to secure sensitive data. The United States government has been using AES since June 2003 to protect sensitive and essential information. Meanwhile, NTRU protects sensitive data against attacks through the use of quantum computers, which can break the RSA cryptosystem and elliptic curve cryptography algorithms. A hybrid of AES and NTRU is developed in this work to improve EMR security. The proposed hybrid cryptography technique is implemented to secure the data transmission process of EMRs. The proposed security solution can provide protection for over 40 years and is resistant to quantum computers. Moreover, the technique provides the necessary evidence required by law to identify disclosure or misuse of patient records. The proposed solution can effectively secure EMR transmission and protect patient rights. It also identifies the source responsible for disclosing confidential patient records.

(2015),2015,Large-Scale QM/MM Calculations of Hydrogen Bonding Networks for Proton Transfer and Water Inlet Channels for Water Oxidation-Theoretical System Models of the Oxygen-Evolving Complex of Photosystem II,Advances in Quantum Chemistry,"In order to confirm theoretical system models of photosystem II (PSII), quantum mechanics (QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) calculations using a large-scale QM model (QM Model V) have been performed to elucidate hydrogen bonding networks and proton wires for proton release pathways (PRPs) of water oxidation reaction in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII. Full geometry optimizations of PRP by the QM/MM model have been carried out starting from the geometry of heavy atoms determined by the recent high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment on PSII refined to 1.9Å resolution. The optimized MnMn and CaMn distances by large-scale QM/MM are consistent with the EXAFS results, removing out the discrepancy between the refined XRD and EXAFS. Computational results from QM/MM calculations have demonstrated the labile nature of the MnaO(5)Mnd bond of the CaMn4O5 cluster in the OEC of PSII which allows left (L)-opened, quasi-central (CQ)-, and right (R)-opened structures. This confirms the feasibility of the left- and right-hand scenarios for water oxidation in the OEC of PSII that are dependent on the hydrogen bonding networks. The QM/MM computations have elucidated the networks structures: hydrogen bonding O. . .O(N) and O. . .H distances and O(N)H. . .O angles in PRP, together with the ClO(N) and Cl. . .H distances and O(N)H. . .Cl angles for chloride anions. The obtained hydrogen bonding networks are fully consistent with the results from XRD and available experiments such as EXAFS, showing the reliability of our theoretical system model that is crucial for investigations of functions of PSII such as water oxidation. The QM/MM computations have elucidated possible roles of chloride anions in OEC of PSII for proton transfers. The QM/MM computational results have provided useful information for the understanding and explanation of several experimental results obtained with mutants of the OEC of PSII. The possible implications of the present results are discussed in relation to our theoretical system models of PSII, strong or weak perturbations of the system structures by mutations, damage-free X-ray free-electron laser structure of PSII, and bioinspired working hypotheses for the development of artificial water oxidation systems which use 3d transition metal complexes. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/bs.aiq.2014.10.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923102137&doi=10.1016%2fbs.aiq.2014.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=2d245433a38f06829bc169bfe954854a,Book Chapter
1846,Scopus,Horváth & Vroom (2015),2015,Ubiquitous computer aided design: A broken promise or a Sleeping Beauty?,CAD Computer Aided Design,"As a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain-computer interfacing, cyber-physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1016/j.cad.2014.10.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84922365791&doi=10.1016%2fj.cad.2014.10.006&partnerID=40&md5=15523c77ab4d83767567c37f21ccce23,Article

Proposed by Boltzmann as entropy, information has evolved into a common paradigm in science, economy, and culture, superseding energy in this role. As an integrating factor of the natural sciences at least, it lends itself as guiding principle for innovative teaching that transcends the frontiers of the traditional disciplines and emphasizes general viewpoints. Based on this idea, the postgraduate topical lecture presented here is intended to provide a firm conceptual basis, technically precise but versatile enough to be applied to specific topics from a broad range of fields. Basic notions of physics like causality, chance, irreversibility, symmetry, disorder, chaos, complexity can be reinterpreted on a common footing in terms of information and information flow. Dissipation and deterministic chaos, exemplifying information currents between macroscopic and microscopic scales, receive special attention. An important part is dedicated to quantum mechanics as an approach to physics that takes the finiteness of information systematically into account. Emblematic features like entanglement and non-locality appear as natural consequences. The course has been planned and tested for an audience comprising, besides physicists, students of other natural sciences as well as mathematics, informatics, engineering, sociology, and philosophy.

The day-to-day lifestyle has been significantly affected by the advancement in communication systems, information systems and consumer electronics. The lifeline of progress has been the invention of the transistor and its dynamic up-gradation. Discovery of fabricating Integrated Circuits (IC's) revolutionized the concept of electronic circuits. With advent of time the size of components decreased, which led to increase in component density. This trend of decreasing device size and denser integrated circuits is being limited by the current lithography techniques. Non-uniformity of doping, quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons from source to drain and leakage of electrons through gate oxide limit scaling down of devices. Heat dissipation and capacitive coupling between circuit components becomes significant with decreasing size of the components. Along with the intrinsic technical limitations, downscaling of devices to nanometer sizes leads to a change in the physical mechanisms controlling the charge propagation. To deal with this constraint, the search is on to look around for alternative materials for electronic device application and new methods for electronic device fabrication. Such material is comprised of organic molecules, proteins, carbon materials, DNA and the list is endless which can be grown in the laboratory. Many molecules show interesting electronic properties, which make them probable candidates for electronic device applications.

Quantum cryptography, or quantum key distribution (QKD), relying on the physical laws of quantum mechanics, stands out as a more powerful cryptographic solution that enables the secret key to be shared securely over publicly unsecured communication channels in the presence of eavesdroppers. QKD can be possibly implemented over both optical fiber and free-space optical (FSO) links. Compared to optical fiber, FSO has the immediate advantage of flexibility and cost-effectiveness in terms of infrastructure deployment. More interestingly, recent advancements in satellite communications using FSO links promise the future of a global QKD network for highly secure applications. This paper reviews the development of QKD over FSO for both terrestrial and satellite channels, which highlights the most up-to-date QKD protocols. Owing to how the information is encoded, different QKD protocols are classified into technology-focused categories, where their properties are reviewed and compared. The feasibility of current QKD protocols is then investigated with respect to its specific application scenarios for terrestrial and satellite FSO links, equipped with results from both theoretical and experimental studies. Based on the latest free-space QKD achievements, novel perspectives for future developments and challenges to enhance the secrecy performance and reduce implementation cost are then summarized and comprehensively discussed.

The destructive use of quantum steganography methods to establish illegal covert communications is rising, so it is essential to introduce ways to detect hidden data in a quantum medium. Accordingly, this paper presents a frequency-based universal audio steganalysis approach to detecting quantum steganography. First, based on the quantum Fourier transform, the characteristic of the quantum spectrum centroid (QSC) was computed, and its circuit network was implemented to extract feature vectors. The proposed method classifies quantum audio signals using a quantum machine learning approach called a quantum ensemble of quantum classifiers. This approach was implemented within the framework of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which uses the superposition property to create an ensemble of classifiers evaluated in parallel, significantly increasing the computational speed. The accuracy weight of the classifiers is adjusted based on the classifiers' performance in training data classification; finally, the measurement of the first n qubits of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm predicts whether the quantum audio signals belong to the stego or clean class. The idea stems from the classic ensemble methods that try to build more robust models by combining different classifiers. The results show that the proposed frequency domain steganalysis method with 95% accuracy performs better than the previous methods in the time domain.",,10.1007/s00034-022-02208-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00034-022-02208-y,Journal

QKD is an innovative technology that exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute unconditionally secure shared key for use in cryptographic applications. Currently, many symmetric key cryptographic tools, which are known to be quantum-safe. They all share secret symmetric keys, through untrusted communication, which finished with public-key systems, which are prone to quantum attacks. One of the recommended solutions to the key distribution problem is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). QKD can be used to generate secret keys that are secure against any future algorithmic / computational improvements. QKD utilizes an authenticated communication channel along with a quantum communication channel so that a secret key generated. Whatever may be the protocol to implement proposed QKD, they all need both a quantum channel and an authenticated classical. OTP (One Time Pad) is a randomly generated key.

1867,WOS,Abdulkarim & Engelbrecht (2019),2019,Time Series Forecasting Using Neural Networks: Are Recurrent Connections Necessary?,NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS,"Artificial neural networks (NNs) are widely used in modeling and forecasting time series. Since most practical time series are non-stationary, NN forecasters are often implemented using recurrent/delayed connections to handle the temporal component of the time varying sequence. These recurrent/delayed connections increase the number of weights required to be optimized during training of the NN. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is now an established method for training NNs, and was shown in several studies to outperform the classical backpropagation training algorithm. The original PSO was, however, designed for static environments. In dealing with non-stationary data, modified versions of PSOs for optimization in dynamic environments are used. These dynamic PSOs have been successfully used to train NNs on classification problems under non-stationary environments. This paper formulates training of a NN forecaster as dynamic optimization problem to investigate if recurrent/delayed connections are necessary in a NN time series forecaster when a dynamic PSO is used as the training algorithm. Experiments were carried out on eight forecasting problems. For each problem, a feedforward NN (FNN) is trained with a dynamic PSO algorithm and the performance is compared to that obtained from four different types of recurrent NNs (RNN) each trained using gradient descent, a standard PSO for static environments and the dynamic PSO algorithm. The RNNs employed were an Elman NN, a Jordan NN, a multirecurrent NN and a time delay NN. The performance of these forecasting models were evaluated under three different dynamic environmental scenarios. The results show that the FNNs trained with the dynamic PSO significantly outperformed all the RNNs trained using any of the other algorithms considered. These findings highlight that recurrent/delayed connections are not necessary in NNs used for time series forecasting (for the time series considered in this study) as long as a dynamic PSO algorithm is used as the training method.",,10.1007/s11063-019-10061-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-019-10061-5,Journal

This was recently shown to be a computationally intractable (NP-hard) problem. Financial crashes are inherently difficult to predict, even for a regulator which has complete information about the financial system. In this Rapid Communication, we show how this problem can be handled by quantum annealers. More specifically, we map the equilibrium condition of a toy-model financial network to the ground-state problem of a spin-1/2 quantum Hamiltonian with two-body interactions, i.e., a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. The equilibrium market values of institutions after a sudden shock to the network can then be calculated via adiabatic quantum computation and, more generically, by quantum annealers.

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and - due to their long life span - also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), namely NewHope, NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and Saber.

A global quantum repeater network involving satellite-based links is likely to have advantages over fiber-based networks in terms of long-distance communication, since the photon losses in vacuum scale only polynomially with the distance - compared to the exponential losses in optical fibers. To simulate the performance of such networks, we have introduced a scheme of large-scale event-based Monte Carlo simulation of quantum repeaters with multiple memories that can faithfully represent loss and imperfections in these memories. In this work, we identify the quantum key distribution rates achievable in various satellite and ground station geometries for feasible experimental parameters.

For a QKD network of n users, this method requires C-n(2) = n(n - 1)/2 pairs of symmetric keys to realize pairwise interconnection. In contrast, with the help of a mature public key infrastructure (PKI) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with quantum-resistant security, each user only needs to apply for one digital certificate from a certificate authority (CA) to achieve efficient and secure authentication for QKD.

(2022),2022,Edge Caching in Fog-Based Sensor Networks through Deep Learning-Associated Quantum Computing Framework,COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,"Fog computing (FC) based sensor networks have emerged as a propitious archetype for next-generation wireless communication technology with caching, communication, and storage capacity services in the edge. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new era of digital communication and has a rising demand for intelligent devices and applications. It faces performance deterioration and quality of service (QoS) degradation problems, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) based scenarios. Therefore, existing caching strategies need to be enhanced to augment the cache hit ratio and manage the limited storage to accelerate content deliveries. Alternatively, quantum computing (QC) appears to be a prospect of more or less every typical computing problem. The framework is basically a merger of a deep learning (DL) agent deployed at the network edge with a quantum memory module (QMM). Firstly, the DL agent prioritizes caching contents via self organizing maps (SOMs) algorithm, and secondly, the prioritized contents are stored in QMM using a Two-Level Spin Quantum Phenomenon (TLSQP). After selecting the most appropriate lattice map (32x32) in 750,000 iterations using SOMs, the data points below the dark blue region are mapped onto the data frame to get the videos. These videos are considered a high priority for trending according to the input parameters provided in the dataset. Similarly, the light-blue color region is also mapped to get medium-prioritized content. After the SOMs algorithm's training, the topographic error (TE) value together with quantization error (QE) value (i.e., 0.0000235) plotted the most appropriate map after 750,000 iterations. In addition, the power of QC is due to the inherent quantum parallelism (QP) associated with the superposition and entanglement principles. A quantum computer taking n qubits that can be stored and execute 2(n) presumable combinations of qubits simultaneously reduces the utilization of resources compared to conventional computing. It can be analyzed that the cache hit ratio will be improved by ranking the content, removing redundant and least important content, storing the content having high and medium prioritization using QP efficiently, and delivering precise results. The experiments for content prioritization are conducted using Google Colab, and IBM's Quantum Experience is considered to simulate the quantum phenomena.",,10.1155/2022/6138434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6138434,Journal

Thus, the US NIST is currently exploring new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are robust against quantum computers. Security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices-even with pre-quantum public-key cryptography-since IoT devices have tight energy constraints, limited computational power and strict memory limitations. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth investigation of the application of potential post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms (DSAs) proposed in the related US NIST process to a state-of-the-art, TLS-based, low-power IoT infrastructure. We implemented these new KEMs and DSAs in such a representative infrastructure and measured their impact on energy consumption, latency and memory requirements during TLS handshakes on an IoT edge device. Based on our investigations, we gained the following new insights. First, we show that the main contributor to high TLS handshake latency is the higher bandwidth requirement of post-quantum primitives rather than the cryptographic computation itself. Second, we demonstrate that a smart combination of multiple DSAs yields the most energy-, latency- and memory-efficient public key infrastructures, in contrast to NIST's goal to standardize only one algorithm. Third, we show that code-based, isogeny-based and lattice-based algorithms can be implemented on a low-power IoT edge device based on an off-the-shelf Cortex M4 microcontroller while maintaining viable battery runtimes.

It does so by exactly solving a related network Boolean satisfiability counting problem (or #SAT(NET)), represented as a TN, by counting configurations in which all network nodes are connected to at least a neighbor. Our #SAT(NET )counting outperforms state-of-the-art approximate and exact counters for the same problem as shown for challenging two-dimensional lattice networks of increasing size. While the over-counting from #SAT NET increases exponentially relative to the number of configurations that satisfy ATR problems (or #RELAT), the bias is predictable for ideal networks, such as lattices, and our upper bound is guaranteed with 100% confidence. This bound also cuts through the upper bound from other analytical methods for the ATR problem, such as recursive decomposition algorithms (RDA)-a desirable feature when exact or approximate methods with error guarantees fail to scale. Clearly, our goal is not to solve the general stochastic network reliability problem, which remains a #P problem in the computational complexity hierarchy (i.e., a counting version of non-deterministic polynomial time [NP] problems for which there is no known polynomial time algorithms to find their solutions). Instead, we present a novel bounding technique for network reliability, which relies on exactly counting configurations for our network satisfiability problem by using quantum computing principles. We offer a proof for the counting bound to hold in a connectivity ATR sense, and illustrate trends with cubic and lattice networks. Overall, the proposed method provides an alternative to available system reliability assessment approaches, and opens directions for future research, especially as discoveries in logic, algebraic projections, and quantum computation continue to accrue.",,10.1016/j.strusafe.2018.05.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2018.05.004,Journal

There are quantum neurons that can carry an exponential amount of information to a linear number of quantum information units (qubits) using the quantum property of superposition. In this paper, we compare the performance of three of these quantum neuron models applied to the diabetes classification problem. We also propose the use of different data preprocessing strategies. Quantum neurons were simulated using the IBM Qiskit tool. We compare the preprocessing approaches applied to two toy problems (1) simulating the XOR operator and (2) solving a generic nonlinear problem. The results of the experiments shows that a single quantum neuron is capable of achieving an accuracy rate of 100% in the XOR problem and an accuracy rate of 100% in a non-linear dataset, demonstrating that the quantum neurons with real weights are capable of modeling non-linearly separable problems.

Both of these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Heuristic stochastic optimization methods like genetic algorithm perform global search, but they suffer from the problem of slow convergence rate near global optimum. On the other hand deterministic methods like gradient descent exhibit a fast convergence rate around global optimum but may get stuck in a local optimum. Motivated by these problems, a hybrid learning algorithm combining genetic algorithm (GA) with gradient descent (GD), called HGAGD, is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm combines the global exploration ability of GA with the accurate local exploitation ability of GD to achieve a faster convergence and also a better accuracy of final solution. The HGAGD is then employed as a new training method to optimize the parameters of a quantum-inspired neural network (QINN) for two different applications. Firstly, two benchmark functions are chosen to demonstrate the potential of the proposed QINN with the HGAGD algorithm in dealing with function approximation problems.

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts.

1953,WOS,Zeilinger (2017),2017,Light for the quantum. Entangled photons and their applications: a very personal perspective,PHYSICA SCRIPTA,"The quantum physics of light is a most fascinating field. Here I present a very personal viewpoint, focusing on my own path to quantum entanglement and then on to applications. I have been fascinated by quantum physics ever since I heard about it for the first time in school. The theory struck me immediately for two reasons: (1) its immense mathematical beauty, and (2) the unparalleled precision to which its predictions have been verified again and again. Particularly fascinating for me were the predictions of quantum mechanics for individual particles, individual quantum systems. Surprisingly, the experimental realization of many of these fundamental phenomena has led to novel ideas for applications. Starting from my early experiments with neutrons, I later became interested in quantum entanglement, initially focusing on multi-particle entanglement like GHZ states. This work opened the experimental possibility to do quantum teleportation and quantum hyper-dense coding. The latter became the first entanglement-based quantum experiment breaking a classical limitation. One of the most fascinating phenomena is entanglement swapping, the teleportation of an entangled state. This phenomenon is fundamentally interesting because it can entangle two pairs of particles which do not share any common past. Surprisingly, it also became an important ingredient in a number of applications, including quantum repeaters which will connect future quantum computers with each other. Another application is entanglement-based quantum cryptography where I present some recent long-distance experiments. Entanglement swapping has also been applied in very recent so-called loophole-free tests of Bell's theorem. Within the physics community such loophole-free experiments are perceived as providing nearly definitive proof that local realism is untenable. While, out of principle, local realism can never be excluded entirely, the 2015 achievements narrow down the remaining possibilities for local realistic explanations of the quantum phenomenon of entanglement in a significant way. These experiments may go down in the history books of science. Future experiments will address particularly the freedom-of-choice loophole using cosmic sources of randomness. Such experiments confirm that unconditionally secure quantum cryptography is possible, since quantum cryptography based on Bell's theorem can provide unconditional security. The fact that the experiments were loophole-free proves that an eavesdropper cannot avoid detection in an experiment that correctly follows the protocol. I finally discuss some recent experiments with single- and entangled-photon states in higher dimensions. Such experiments realized quantum entanglement between two photons, each with quantum numbers beyond 10 000 and also simultaneous entanglement of two photons where each carries more than 100 dimensions. Thus they offer the possibility of quantum communication with more than one bit or qubit per photon. The paper concludes discussing Einstein's contributions and viewpoints of quantum mechanics. Even if some of his positions are not supported by recent experiments, he has to be given credit for the fact that his analysis of fundamental issues gave rise to developments which led to a new information technology. Finally, I reflect on some of the lessons learned by the fact that nature cannot be local, that objective randomness exists and about the emergence of a classical world. It is suggestive that information plays a fundamental role also in the foundations of quantum physics.",,10.1088/1402-4896/aa736d,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1402-4896/aa736d,Journal

To figure out this problem and enhance the forecasting performance, a novel compound structure is developed for short-term wind speed forecasting. The developed compound method firstly eliminates the inherent noise from the original empirical wind speed time series using wavelet packet decom-position (WPD) and subsequently constructs appropriate input matrix by phase space reconstruction (PSR) for multi-kernel least square support vector machine (MKLSSVM). To take advantage of different kernel function, MKLSSVM with optimal combination of radial basis kernel function, polynomial kernel function and linear kernel function is constructed to make wind speed forecasting. Then, the proposed improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) based on the chaos initialization, Gaussian distribution local attraction points, precocity judgment, and disturbance operator, namely ADQPSO, is employed to optimize the decomposition level of WPD, reconstruction parameters of PSR, kernel parameters and weighted coefficients in MKLSSVM synchronously. To evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model, four sets of historical wind speed data samples from Weihai wind farm in China are utilized to make multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting tests. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the compared single and new recently developed forecasting models, thus, the proposed WPD-PSR-ADQPSO-MKLSSVM is an effective method for short-term wind speed forecasting.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

In doing so, the convergence to two different stable states namely, consensus and synchronous states have been studied.

It is not clear how to handle such new effects in information theory.

The purpose of this paper is to survey the progress for modeling the quantum noise effects that information theorists are likely to face in the future, to cope with such nontrivial errors mentioned above. This paper explains a channel error model to represent strange properties of error probability due to new quantum noise. By this model, specific examples on the features of error probability caused by, for example, quantum recurrence effects, collective relaxation, and external force, are given.

The proposed method uses a moving average (MA) indicator, which has been commonly used in financial fields, to apply to neighbors of sensor nodes; it becomes a dynamic detection indicator of the number of neighbor nodes.

In daylight free-space quantum communication based on direct detection, the required Field Of View (FoV) of the receiver system needs to be minimised to reduce solar background noise coupling into the detectors. Reducing the FoV requires minimising beam wander effects caused by atmospheric turbulence through active optics. We implement a fine tracking system designed to correct tip and tilt wavefront aberrations, using two feedback loops; each of them consisting of a quadrant detector and a fast steering mirror for stabilising the beam in the whole optical axis of the receiver. We test the performance of the tracking system with different optical fibres in order to evaluate the reduction in the quantum bit error rate (QBER) caused by solar background noise. A reduction of 75% for single mode fibre was obtained, and 45% reduction for a 25 mu m core diameter fibre, both cases for strong turbulence (C-n(2) similar to 10(-12) -10(-13) m(-2/3)) and 100 m propagating channel.

In general, single-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) can provide satisfactory forecasting results, but classical gradient-based learning algorithms are time consuming and easily trapped into local optimums. As a new training method for SLFNs, extreme learning machine (ELM) has faster training speed and stronger nonlinear mapping than gradient-based algorithms, and provides an effective technique for hydrologic time-series prediction. However, ELM may converge to local minimums in some cases due to the random determination of input weights and hidden biases. Thus, in order to overcome the shortcomings of ELM, this paper introduces a novel ELM-quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) model (ELM-QPSO) combining the advantages of ELM and QPSO. The proposed model adopts the QPSO algorithm to select the optimal input-hidden weights and hidden biases of ELM, and uses the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse to analytically determine the output weights. The proposed approach is assessed with daily runoff data of Xinfengjiang reservoir in China from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2014. The results indicate that the ELM-QPSO can significantly improve the generalization performance of ELM for hydrologic time-series prediction, and that QPSO is an alternative training algorithm for ELM parameters selection.

In the proposed scheme, arbitrary N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state could be sent to N receivers via a 2N-qubit partially entangled state. Specially, the proposed scheme is accomplished with controlled-NOT gates, which ensure the scheme is more efficient and easier to be implemented. In addition, we construct the quantum circuit simulations and the partially entangled channel on IBMQ to prove the feasibility of the scheme.

In this paper, we discuss the development of GaN-based visible SLDs, and analyze their electro-optical properties by studying the optical power-bandwidth products and injection current densities. The significant progress in blue SLDs and their applications for white light VLC is highlighted. A blue SLD, with an optical power of >100 mW and large PRP of 536 mW.nm, is utilized to generate white light, resulting in a high color rendering index (CRI) of 88.2. In a modulation experiment designed for an SLD-based VLC system, an on-off keying scheme exhibits a 1.2 Gbps data rate, with a bit error rate of 1.8 x 10(-3), which satisfies the forward error correction criteria. A high data rate of 3.4 Gbps is achieved using the same SLD transmitter, by applying the 16-quadrature-amplitude-modulation (16-QAM) discrete multitone modulation scheme for high-speed white light communication. The results reported here unequivocally point to the significant performance and versatility that GaN-based SLDs could offer for beyond-5G implementation, where white lighting and high spectral efficiency VLC systems can be simultaneously implemented.",,10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2915995,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2915995,Journal

The proposed diagnostic technology directly couples a piezoelectric transducer signal into a Fowler-Nordheim (FN) quantum tunneling-based synchronized dynamical system to record the mechanical usage of spinal fixation devices. The operation of the proposed implantable FN sensor-data-logger is completely self-powered by harvesting the energy from the micro-motion of the spine during the course of fusion. Bench-top testing is performed using corpectomy models to evaluate the performance of the proposed monitoring system. In order to simulate the spinal fusion process, different materials with gradually increasing elastic modulus are used to fill the intervertebral space gap. Besides, finite element models are developed to analyze the strains induced on the spinal rods during the applied cyclic loading. Data measured from the benchtop experiment is processed using an FN sensor-data-logger model to obtain time-evolution curves representing each spinal fusion state. This feasibility study shows that the obtained curves are viable tools to differentiate between conditions of osseous union and assess the effective fusion period.",,10.1109/TBME.2021.3103776,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2021.3103776,Journal

Zhang et al. study the effects of adversarial perturbations on a neural-network-based topological phase classifier, applied to experimental data from an NV center in diamond. Classification and identification of different phases and the transitions between them is a central task in condensed matter physics. Machine learning, which has achieved dramatic success in a wide range of applications, holds the promise to bring unprecedented perspectives for this challenging task. However, despite the exciting progress made along this direction, the reliability of machine-learning approaches in experimental settings demands further investigation. Here, with the nitrogen-vacancy center platform, we report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of adversarial examples in learning topological phases. We show that the experimental noises are more likely to act as adversarial perturbations when a larger percentage of the input data are dropped or unavailable for the neural network-based classifiers. We experimentally implement adversarial examples which can deceive the phase classifier with a high confidence, while keeping the topological properties of the simulated Hopf insulators unchanged.

In this paper, we present a quantum teleportation procedure that capable to teleport either accelerated or non-accelerated information through different quantum channels. These quantum channels are based on accelerated multi-qubit states, where each qubit of each of these channels represents a partner. Namely, these states are the W state, Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the GHZ-like state. Here, we show that the fidelity of teleporting accelerated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non-accelerated information, both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state. Also, the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that the degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel, type of the measurement, and value of the acceleration. The result of comparison concludes that teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is more robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the other two states. For future work, the proposed procedure can be generalized later to achieve communication through a wider quantum network.",,,,Journal

Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to select the optimal parameters influencing the performance of SVR. And in order to improve the problem that the fixed SVR model is difficult to adapt to the highly nonlinear process, a simple online SVR based on re-modeling method is proposed instead of the fixed one. According to hourly PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations and meteorological conditions from May 2014 to April 2015 in Wanliu Monitoring Station of Beijing in China, the experiment is carried out based on the data of 3 months. Meanwhile, PM2.5 concentration is predicted by three different prediction methods, including the recursive prediction method, direct prediction method, and online direct prediction method. The results show that the online direct prediction method is the most accurate in the three prediction methods. In addition, compared with original particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, QPSO algorithm is tested more efficiently for the improvement of global search ability and robustness during the procedure of parameter selection. Moreover, the hybrid QPSO-SVR model proposed in this paper has higher prediction accuracy and less computational time compared with the PSO-SVR model, genetic algorithm (GA)-SVR model, and grid search (GS)-SVR model, which indicates reliability and effectiveness of the QPSO-SVR model in prediction of these two pollutant concentrations.",,10.1007/s10666-018-9633-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-018-9633-3,Journal

To increase the information transmission efficiency and practicability of semi-quantum secure direct communication, a bidirectional semi-quantum secure direct communication protocol with high-dimensional single-particle states is designed. Theproposed protocol involves quantum party Alice and classical party Bob. Each participant can receive a secret message while sending a secret message. Unlike most of existing quantum secure direct communication protocols, it is not necessary for the classical party Bob in the proposed protocol to possess the capability of measuring quantum states, which greatly enhances the feasibility of the protocol. The protocol allows the classical party Bob to implement the unitary operations on particles and reorder the quantum sequence. Furthermore, the quantum party Alice and the classical party Bob can verify the correctness of the receivedsecret message with the Hash function. Security analysis indicates that without being discovered by thelegitimate participants, Eve cannot obtain the secret message with common attack, such as intercept-resend attack, measure-resend attack, tampering attack and entanglement-measure attack.

Along with this trend, there emerge quantum neural architectures based on different designs of quantum neurons. A fundamental question in quantum deep learning arises: what is the best quantum neural architecture? Inspired by the design of neural architectures for classical computing which typically employs multiple types of neurons, this paper makes the very first attempt to mix quantum neuron designs to build quantum neural architectures. We observe that the existing quantum neuron designs may be quite different but complementary, such as neurons from variational quantum circuits (VQC) and Quantumflow. More specifically, VQC can apply real-valued weights but suffer from being extended to multiple layers, while QuantumFlow can build a multi-layer network efficiently, but is limited to use binary weights. To take their respective advantages, we propose to mix them together and figure out a way to connect them seamlessly without additional costly measurement. We further investigate the design principles to mix quantum neurons, which can provide guidance for quantum neural architecture exploration in the future. Experimental results demonstrate that the identified quantum neural architectures with mixed quantum neurons can achieve 90.62% of accuracy on the MNIST dataset, compared with 52.77% and 69.92% on the VQC and QuantumFlow, respectively.",,10.1109/ICCAD51958.2021.9643575,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD51958.2021.9643575,Conference Paper
2020,WOS,Amato et al. (2017),2017,Beyond the Limits of Classic Backscattering Communications: a Quantum Tunneling RFID Tag,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RFID (RFID),"Sensor networks, radio-equipped drones, and satellites are widely used to retrieve sensor data in many applications such as health care, smart cities and precision agriculture. Nevertheless, the high-power costs of communication per distance unit lead to poor technical solutions, particularly in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A future of devices connected through an Internet of Things (IoT) network will require billions of sensors that will affect costs and increase the energy requirements if not equipped with backscattering technologies such as RFID. This work shows how a quantum tunneling RFID tag enables the use of RFIDs in new applications by minimizing battery waste and by drastically improving the range of backscattering systems. The highly sensitive 5.8 GHz quantum tunneling RFID tag achieves backscattering free space ranges above 1.2 km while consuming biasing powers as low as 20.4 mu W. This is over 10 times higher than the maximum range of a semi-passive 5.8 GHz RFID ideal link. The quantum tunneling tag is characterized by return gains as high as 35 dB, a simple RF front-end, a sensitivity of -84 dBm, and increasing SNRs for increasing RF impinging powers. This work lays out the basis for both entrepreneurial and research activities that will lead to a new class of long-range backscattering passive sensors with power consumption far lower than traditional radios.",,,,Conference Paper

(2018),2018,Opportunities and challenges for quantum-assisted machine learning in near-term quantum computers,QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and quantum supremacy, machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising 'killer' applications. Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect between most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the capabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in the near future. In this contribution to the focus collection 'What would you do with 1000 qubits?', we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key challenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well from this hybrid quantum-classical framework.",,10.1088/2058-9565/aab859,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/aab859,Journal

As long as the channel noise is less than the noise tolerance of the protocol, Alice and Bob can withdraw a secure key. The proposed protocol has advantages over previous protocols regarding qubit efficiency and communication cost.

Nowadays, QKD integrated in backbone, metro, and access areas has been respectively studied and tested around the world. Although the experiments in various scenarios can verify the feasibility of QKD, the situation of QKD between two end users from metro to access networks has not been considered up to now. In this paper, we propose a QKD Network (QKDN) architecture for end-to-end QKD from metro to access networks in a costefficient manner. The cost efficiency can be achieved by sharing Quantum Receivers (Qrecs) in the metro network with the Quantum Transmitters (Qtras) in various access networks since the distance between any two end users within a metro network permits to distribute quantum keys. Under such an architecture, an end-to-end QKD scheme is designed to provide secret keys for end users in different access networks, by mapping Qrecs and allocating time slots according to security requests. Through the end-to-end QKD scheme, the occupation of Qrecs and time slots can be appropriately improved. To verify the effectiveness of the scheme, simulation is conducted on two different topologies respectively. Performances are evaluated in terms of three parameters: i) the failure ratio of end-to-end QKD (FQ), ii) the utilization ratio of time slots (TU), and iii) the utilization ratio of Qrecs (QU). Simulation results show that the topology with more nodes will lower the QU by distributing requests to more numbers of Qrecs. Moreover, the topology with bigger node connectivity can lower FQ since a shorter path will be selected to save the unnecessary occupation of link resources for other end-to-end requests.",,,,Conference Paper

For large-scale ion-trap-based quantum computers and networks, it is critical to have two types of qubit: one for computation and storage, and another for auxiliary operations such as qubit detection(3), sympathetic cooling(4-7) and entanglement generation through photon links(8,9). Although the two qubit types can be implemented using two different ion species(3,10-13), this approach introduces substantial complexity into creating and controlling each qubit type(14,)(15). Here we resolve these challenges by implementing two coherently convertible qubit types using one ion species. We encode the qubits into two pairs of clock states of the Yb-171(+) ions, and achieve microsecond-level conversion rates between the two types with one-way fidelities of 99.5%. We further demonstrate that operations on one qubit type, including sympathetic laser cooling, single-qubit gates and qubit detection, have crosstalk errors less than 0.06% on the other type, which is below the best-known error threshold of similar to 1% for fault-tolerant quantum computing using the surface code(1,)(16).

One of the notable examples is the introduction of IoT-based smart home services (SHS), which aims to provide ubiquitous sensing and intelligent control at home. Security is an important issue in SHS that needs to be resolved before it can receive wide adoption. In this paper, we propose BC-SHS, a consortium blockchain to protect the IoT-based SHS. The SHS within a community forms a consortium blockchain, while the cloud service provider (CSP) joins the consortium blockchain to provide services through smart contracts. External communication (between smart homes and cloud servers) goes through this consortium blockchain, which ensures integrity, authenticity, auditability and privacy preservation of SHSs. In addition to this, we analyse state of the art post-quantum signature schemes and propose to adopt pqNTRUsign as a replacement to the existing ECDSA signature scheme. This can help to protect the proposed BC-SHS from potential quantum computer attack in future. We provide analysis on the proposed BC-SHS in terms of security, deployment cost and communication overhead.",,,,Journal

(2021),2021,An Introduction to Practical Quantum Key Distribution,IEEE AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS MAGAZINE,"Quantum technology, and especially quantum computing, is advancing rapidly. Our every-day secure communication infrastructure relies heavily on public key cryptography; unfortunately, many public key schemes are in fact insecure against quantum algorithms. Furthermore, adversaries who, today, capture information encrypted using classical key distribution systems, can wait and, as soon as quantum computers of sufficient power become available, they may decipher all previously captured information. While some new post-quantum public key systems are assumed to be secure against quantum computers, this is only an assumption and, even if the assumption remains valid, still results in systems that are less efficient for end-users than the more commonly used public key systems employed today. While the advent of quantum technology may seem detrimental to security, in fact, one may harness the power of quantum through quantum key distribution (QKD) for stronger security guarantees. Such QKD protocols allow two (or more) parties to establish a shared secret key, secure against an all-powerful adversary. Perhaps surprising is that QKD technology is already here both experimentally and commercially. This tutorial serves as an introduction to basic QKD along with QKD technology from a practical perspective.

Different control strategies are used to reallocate the thruster forces. For the cases that thrusters are partly malfunctioning, a weighted pseudo-inverse is firstly used to generate the normalised thruster forces. When the normalised thruster forces are out of maximum limits, the Quantum-behaviour Particle Swarm Optimisation (QPSO) is used for the restricted usage of the faulty thruster and to find the solution of the control reallocation problem within the limits.

However, the training task of QNNs is challenging and much less understood. We conduct a quantitative investigation on the landscape of loss functions of QNNs and identify a class of simple yet extremely hard QNN instances for training. Specifically, we show for typical under-parameterized QNNs, there exists a dataset that induces a loss function with the number of spurious local minima depending exponentially on the number of parameters. Moreover, we show the optimality of our construction by providing an almost matching upper bound on such dependence. While local minima in classical neural networks are due to non-linear activations, in quantum neural networks local minima appear as a result of the quantum interference phenomenon.

Photonic platforms have gained significant attention owing to the appealing properties that they offer, namely small probabilities of decoherence emergence, as well as being readily manipulable. In this regard, single-photon emitters play an integral role, and advancements in the design of single-photon sources, providing an anti-bunching photon correlation, have transitioned from its formerly proof-of-concept status to engineering attempts, and this has realized thanks to the ever-increasing improvements in the development of promising material platforms. In the race toward the realization of on-demand single-photon sources, solid-state host systems and in particular the quantum dot (QD)-based schemes, have very-well taken advantage of the recent headways in the bottom-up nanofabrication procedures. In this contribution, a review is presented on the recent progress and the existing challenges in fabrication of single-photon emitters, based on QD-containing nanowires (NWs) and their principles of operation. More specifically, we will consider how variation in values of different parameters, such as the purity, height and diameter of the NW waveguides, the electric-dipole orientation of the embedded QD, as well as different waveguide geometries, fabrication techniques and conditions exploited in their manufacturing, will affect the desired outputs in the system, i.e., the narrow photoluminescence spectrum, ideal single-photon emission of sufficient lifetime, and also the Gaussian profile in the far-field distribution.

In this paper, a plug-and-play measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) scheme with MRR is proposed not only to eliminate detector side channels and allow an untrusted satellite relay between two users, but also to simplify the requirements set-ups in practical flexible moving scenarios. The plug-and-play architecture compensates for the polarization drift during the transmission to provide superior performance in implementing the MDI-QKD on a free-space channel, and the MRR device is adopted to relax the requirements on both communication terminals. A double-pass correlated turbulent channel model is presented to investigate the complex and unstable channel characteristics caused by the atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, the security of the modified MDI-QKD scheme is analyzed under some classical attacks and the simulation results indicate the feasibility under the situation that the system performance deteriorates with the increase of fading correlation coefficient and the turbulence intensity, which provides a meaningful step towards an MDI-QKD based on the moving platforms to join a dynamic quantum network with untrusted relays.",,10.3390/e23101299,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e23101299,Journal

By employing pump-probe driven four-wave mixing as an experimental tool, the wave conversion process shows notably different profiles for the two types of devices. Due to the contributions of ultrafast, sub-picosecond mechanisms, such as carrier heating and spectral hole burning, the pump-probe frequency can be easily tuned to the THz range. SOAs generally benefit more from sub-picosecond carrier dynamics, hence exhibiting a higher conversion efficiency (CE) in the THz range, compared to their laser diode counterparts. The discrepancy even exceeds 10 dB. In addition, laser experiments yield some differences from the amplifier ones, hence leading to a higher nonlinear CE at small detuning ranges.

The prominent feature of the scheme does not need either ancillary entangled photon pairs or the iterative purification procedure. Hence this represents a huge saving in the physical resources to implement entanglement purification. For the purification protocol to improve the fidelity of the output state, it is not essential that the fidelity of the resource states shared is more than 1/4. In addition, the total success probability and fidelity of the present purification scheme can approach unit in principle. The present scheme uses only basic tools in quantum optical laboratories and can be implemented in the regime of the weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity.

The security is then obtained against other network parties even when the quantum signals are broadcast throughout the network. The passive beam splitter is sufficient to deterministically distribute the quantum signals, and standard CV QKD systems can be directly fitted in the downstream-access network, which makes it more applicable for practical implementations. Numerous simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the CV QKD downstream-access network, where up to 64 end users are shown to be feasible to access the network.

Overcoming imperfections in this way remains an important outstanding challenge for quantum science(15,19-27).

Our approach is based on the five-qubit code with a recently discovered flag protocol that enables fault tolerance using a total of seven qubits(28-30).We encode the logical qubit using a new protocol based on repeated multi-qubit measurements and show that it outperforms non-fault-tolerant encoding schemes. We then fault-tolerantly manipulate the logical qubit through a complete set of single-qubit Clifford gates. Finally, we demonstrate flagged stabilizer measurements with real-time processing of the outcomes. Such measurements are a primitive for fault-tolerant quantum error correction.

Restrictions in monolithic quantum computing systems capacity can be overcome by utilizing the distributed circuits. For the implementation of global gates (two-quibt gates whose control and target qubits belong to different partitions), it is required that one qubit be teleported to the other partition. Teleportation is a costly protocol (it requires sharing entanglement between two partitions), and the number of teleportations required for implement a given distributed circuit is called teleportation cost. It is desirable to distribute a quantum computation in such a way that the teleportation cost is reduced. A previous work has presented a way to optimize distributed quantum circuits in terms of teleportation cost for a predetermined partitioning. In this research, Shore circuit to factor number 15 synthesized in the single-qubit and CNOT gates is provided. After that, the circuit partitioning with the minimal cost of communication is presented.",,10.1007/s10773-021-04756-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10773-021-04756-6,Journal

We exploit this clustering and the statically-known control flow of quantum programs to create tractable partitioning heuristics which map quantum circuits to modular physical machines one time slice at a time. Specifically, we create optimized mappings for each time slice, accounting for the cost to move data from the previous time slice and using a tunable lookahead scheme to reduce the cost to move to future time slices. We compare our approach to a traditional statically-mapped, owner-computes model. Our results show strict improvement over the static mapping baseline.

It will embrace emerging technologies, such as quantum communication, molecular communication, real-time intelligent edge, Internet of everything, etc. As a consequence, personal and national safety will highly depend on network and information security. Anticipating future development, ITU-T specifies that Trustworthy Networking should be provided [2]. 6G TSP white paper [1] also indicates that trust should be embedded into networking. On the other hand, security is always a mandatory requirement, which is one of key performance indicators of trust.

Research in this area has focused primarily on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and several proposals to enhance supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with VQAs have been put forward. Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy gradient RL can be extended to inferring optimal Q-values in restricted families of environments.

We also show that any code attempting to exceed this upper bound must incur large error in decoding, which can be viewed as a weaker version of the strong converse results for quantum capacity. As an application, we find nearly matching upper and lower bounds (up to an additive constant) on the quantum capacity of quantum expander channels. Using these techniques, we further conclude that the 'mixture of random unitaries' channels arising in the construction of quantum expanders in [Hastings 2007] show a trend in multiplicativity of output 2-norm similar to that exhibited in [Montanaro 2013] for output infinity-norm of random quantum channels.",,,,Conference Paper

There are already some proposals of application of the quantum algorithm to practical problems, including quantitative finance. In many problems in finance to which Monte Carlo simulation is applied, many random numbers are required to obtain one sample value of the integrand, since those problems are extremely high-dimensional integrations, for example, risk measurement of credit portfolio. This leads to the situation that the required qubit number is too large in the naive implementation where a quantum register is allocated per random number. In this paper, we point out that we can reduce qubits keeping quantum speed up if we perform calculation similar to the classical one, that is, estimate the average of integrand values sampled by a pseudo-random-number generator (PRNG) implemented on a quantum circuit. We present not only the overview of the idea but also concrete implementation of PRNG and application to credit risk measurement. Actually, reduction of qubits is a trade-off against increase of circuit depth. Therefore, full reduction might be impractical, but such a trade-off between speed and memory space will be important in adjustment of calculation setting considering machine specs, if large-scale Monte Carlo simulation by quantum computer is in operation in the future.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.102.022424,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.022424,Journal

Remarkably, even when only uncharacterized preparation and measurement devices are present, it is sometimes possible to distinguish between the behaviors of quantum and classical systems from only observational data. Certifying the physical origin of measurement statistics in the prepare and measure scenario is of primal importance for developing quantum networks, distributing quantum keys, and certifying randomness, to mention a few applications, but, surprisingly, no general methods to do so are known. We progress on this problem by crafting a general, sufficient condition to certify that a given set of preparations can only generate classical statistics, for any number of generalized measurements. As an application, we employ the method to demonstrate nonclassicality activation in the prepare and measure scenario, also considering its application in random access codes. Following that, we adapt our method to certify, again through a sufficient condition, whether a given set of measurements can never give rise to nonclassical behaviors, irrespective of what preparations they may act upon. This, in turn, allows us to find a large set of incompatible measurements that cannot be used to demonstrate nonclassicality, thus showing incompatibility is not sufficient for nonclassicality in the prepare and measure scenario.",,10.1103/PRXQuantum2.030311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum2.030311,Journal

Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quan-tum Neural Networks and Variational Quan-tum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum advantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Re-cent works have focused on quantum-aware op-timizers specifically tailored for PQCs. How-ever, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such optimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs: (1) We find an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large degeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast as an exponential reduction in the volume of rel-evant hyperparameter space. (2) We study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it is conserved under uni-tal noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries and lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based on these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based Minima Hop-ping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our numerical simula-tions show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance in the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware. Overall, this work derives large-scale circuit symmetries from local gate trans-formations, and uses them to construct a noise-aware optimization method.",,,,Journal

The selection of the structures in-turn depends on the minimum number of QCA cell usage. In the proposed methodology, an optimised Random Key Generator (RKG) has been constructed using QCA by employing a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) as a select input to the 2:1 MUX. The MUX generates a random key by selecting either Galois Ring Oscillators (GRO) or Fibonacci Ring Oscillators (FRO). Further, the proposed scheme reduces the Flip flop usage into EXOR gates and wire as compared to the conventional design. The clock circuitry used in the QCA platform would decide the initial seed to the FROs, GROs and the LFSR circuitry in QCA which makes the output Random Key Sequence truly unpredictable.

2100,WOS,Coccia & Wang (2015),2015,Path-breaking directions of nanotechnology-based chemotherapy and molecular cancer therapy,TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE,"A fundamental question in the field of technological forecasting and foresight is how to detect likely fruitful technological trajectories in new research fields, such as nanomedicine. We confront this question by developing an approach based on trends and networks of vital variables, analyzed by bibliometrics, which endeavours to detect fruitful trajectories of nanotechnology applied to ground-breaking anti-cancer treatments. Results tend to show two main technological waves of cancer treatments by nanotechnology applications. The early technological wave in the early 2000s was embodied in some types of chemotherapy agents with a broad spectrum of application, while after 2006 the second technological wave appeared with new applications of chemotherapy agents and molecular target therapy by nanotechnology. The present study shows new directions of nanotechnology-based chemotherapy and molecular cancer therapy in new treatments for breast, lung, brain and colon cancers. A main finding of this study is the recognition that, since the late 2000s, the sharp increase of several technological trajectories of anticancer drugs applied by nanotechnology seems to be driven by high rates of mortality of some types of cancers (e.g. pancreatic and brain) in order to find more effective anticancer therapies that increase the progression-free survival of patients: the so-called technological trajectories mortality driven. The study also points out that global research leaders tend to specialize in anticancer drugs, via nanotechnology, for specific cancers (e.g. Switzerland in prostate cancer, Japan in colon cancer, China in ovarian cancer and Greece in pancreatic cancer). These ground-breaking technological trajectories are paving new directions in biomedicine and generating a revolution in clinical practice that may lead to more effective anticancer treatments in the not-too-distant future.

Here we theoretically propose and experimentally realize a scheme that can fully exploit the multi-spatial-mode nature of the four-wave-mixing (FWM) process, i.e., spatial multiplexing, and thus integrates multiple FWM processes into a single cell at each stage of the cascaded process. The number of generated quantum-correlated beams 2(n) is exponentially dependent on the number of vapor cells n. In addition, the quantum correlations between the multiple beams also increase as the number of vapor cell increases. For the case of n = 2, we experimentally show that the degree of intensity-difference squeezing between the four quantum-correlated beams in our scheme is enhanced to -8.2 +/- 0.2 dB from -5.6 +/- 0.3 and -6.5 +/- 0.2 dB of squeezing obtained with a single FWM process.

In the future, as network virtualization technology advances, building and controlling a network for each service is expected to make the network suitable for the service. In this case, it is necessary to design the network construction and operation from the viewpoint of the quality of experience (QoE) of users. Although research on modeling QoE of users has been advanced, the QoE changes according to the user's psychological effect, so it can be hard to model the complete QoE in the conventional model. On the other hand, quantum decision-making has begun to be drawing attention in recent years as a model for expressing human cognitive state and decision-making. In quantum decision-making, it is possible to represent human behavior, which is hard to express in the conventional cognitive model, and it is expected as a more general model.

Chemical modification and functionalization tune the physical and chemical properties, driving GQD towards high-performance DSSC. This is an ideal way of modifying GQD because the chemical adsorption of atoms or molecules prevents the destruction of the carbon network without substitutional impurities. Here, we deliver a short outline of progress in understanding GQD functionalization from theoretical/computational perspectives. This chemically modified GQD is then linked with the performance of DSSC.

Here we propose a scheme to generate such quantum correlation among the TLSs inside a lossy cavity. It is found that, by applying a broadband squeezed laser acting as a squeezed-vacuum reservoir to the cavity, a stable quantum correlation of the TLSs can be generated. By adiabatically eliminating the cavity field, we derive a reduced master equation of the TLSs in the bad-cavity limit. We show that the generated quantum correlation is essentially determined by the squeezing features transferred from the squeezed-vacuum reservoir via the cavity field as a quantum bus. We study the effect of the system parameters, such as the squeezing, the detuning, the coupling strength, and the decay rate of the TLSs, on the performance of the scheme.

2115,WOS,He & Jiang (2018),2018,An evidential dynamical model to predict the interference effect of categorization on decision making results,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,"Categorization is necessary for many decision making tasks. However, the categorization process may interfere the decision making result and bring about the disjunction fallacy. To predict the interference effect of categorization, some models based on quantum cognition theory have been proposed. In quantum dynamical models, like the quantum belief-action entanglement (BAE) model, actions and beliefs are deemed to be entangled. However, the entanglement degree is an artificially defined parameter. In this paper, a new evidential dynamical (ED) model based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory and quantum dynamical modelling is proposed. Considering that sometimes people hesitate to make a decision, it is reasonable to extend the action states by introducing an uncertain state. In an evidential framework, categorization can influence the uncertain state in actions. The interference effect is measured by handling the uncertain state while no extra parameter is defined artificially. The proposed model is applied to the classical categorization decision-making experiments. Compared with the existing models, the number of free parameters in the ED model is less than the classical quantum models, and the ED model is more rational and simpler than an evidential Markov model. The model application results and discussions show the correctness and effectiveness of the ED model. Not only the interference effect of categorization on decision making results is explained and predicted, but also an inspiring dynamical decision making framework is proposed in this paper. We believe that the proposed ED model will bring more opportunities and will result in more applications in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One such encryption scheme, Multi-path Switching with Secret Sharing (MSSS), combines secret sharing with multi-path switching to achieve security as long as the adversary does not have global observability of all paths and thus cannot capture enough shares to reconstruct messages. MSSS assumes that sending a share on a path is an atomic operation and all paths have the same delay. We identify a side-channel vulnerability for MSSS, created by the fact that in real networks, sending a share is not an atomic operation as paths have multiple hops and different delays. This channel, referred to as Network Data Remanence (NDR), is present in all schemes like MSSS whose security relies on transfer atomicity and all paths having the same delay. We demonstrate the presence of NDR in a physical testbed. We then identify two new attacks that aim to exploit the side-channel, referred to as NDR Blind and NDR Planned, propose an analytical model to analyze the attacks, and demonstrate them using an implementation of MSSS based on the ONOS SDN controller.

We achieve the channel transmittance characterized by the refractive index and the wavefront distortions. Moreover, an adaptive optics (AO) unit is used for performance improvement while considering the effect of the thermal noise and excess noise on the atmospheric turbulence bubble-modeled channel. Numerical simulations show that the AO-involved detection scheme can result in reductions in excess noise when being faced with the floating clouds and mist in atmospheric turbulence, which results in performance improvements in terms of secret key rate, which confirms the utility of the high-rate and long-distance CVQKD in terahertz (THz) for practical implementations.",,10.3390/sym14102128,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym14102128,Journal
2125,WOS,Abdelfatah (2022),2022,Quantum Image Encryption Using a Self-Adaptive Hash Function-Controlled Chaotic Map (SAHF-CCM),IEEE ACCESS,"Recently, quantum image encryption algorithms are attracting more and more attention, due to the upcoming quantum threat problem to the current cryptographic encryption algorithms with the rapid progress toward the quantum computer production. The aim of this paper is to introduce a self-adaptive encryption scheme to protect quantum image efficiently with minimal storage requirements. The methodology is to use two rounds of encryption with two different pseudorandom number sequences which are obtained from a new designed pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). This PRNG consists of two parts. The first part is based on iterating a recently proposed chaotic-based parallel keyed hash function which is used as a controller for a second part. The second part is a multiplication of Tent and Chebyshev chaotic maps (TCM). This combination of hash function and chaotic maps provides high randomness and a dramatical increase in the control parameters and initial values number which achieves extremely large key space and so makes the scheme stronger against brute force attacks. The seed or initial value of PRNG depends on the input image itself which makes the scheme self-adaptive and so it is stronger against chosen plaintext attacks and known-plaintext attacks. In the first round of encryption, the value of each pixel qubits of the input image is changed to a new value by XORing it with the corresponding qubits of the first pseudorandom sequence using CNOT and Toffoli quantum gates then shifting to the next qubit with the Swap quantum gate. In this round, the pixel value is changed. In the second round, diffusion of the changed pixel value is extended to each pixel in the input image using the second pseudorandom sequence and Toffoli quantum gates. The time complexity of the proposed scheme is less than many recently published quantum image encryption schemes. The scheme security analysis is discussed, and the experimental results proved that the scheme is robust, secure and efficient.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3212899,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3212899,Journal

Specifically, 3D architectures are currently attracting increasing attention in various fields due to their intriguing properties, while CdS has been most widely utilized for PEC bioanalysis applications because of its narrow band gap, proper conduction band, and stable photocurrent generation. Using CdS as a representative material, this work realized the innovative synthesis of 3D CdS@CF networks via a simple solvothermal process. Exemplified by the sandwich immunoassay of fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP), the as fabricated 3D CdS@CF networks exhibited superior properties, and the assay demonstrated good performance in terms of sensitivity and selectivity. This work features a novel fabrication of 3D CdS@CF networks that can serve as a general platform for PEC bioanalysis.

2127,WOS,Rozenberg et al. (2022),2022,Inverse design of spontaneous parametric downconversion for generation of high-dimensional qudits,OPTICA,"Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in quantum optics is an invaluable resource for the realization of high-dimensional qudits with spatial modes of light. One of the main open challenges is how to directly generate a desirable qudit state in the SPDC process. This problem can be addressed through advanced computational learning methods; however, due to difficulties in modeling the SPDC process by a fully differentiable algorithm, progress has been limited. Here, we overcome these limitations and introduce a physically constrained and differentiable model, validated against experimental results for shaped pump beams and structured crystals, capable of learning the relevant interaction parameters in the process. We avoid any restrictions induced by the stochastic nature of our physical model and integrate the dynamic equations governing the evolution under the SPDC Hamiltonian. We solve the inverse problem of designing a nonlinear quantum optical system that achieves the desired quantum state of downconverted photon pairs. The desired states are defined using either the second-order correlations between different spatial modes or by specifying the required density matrix. By learning nonlinear photonic crystal structures as well as different pump shapes, we successfully show how to generate maximally entangled states. Furthermore, we simulate all-optical coherent control over the generated quantum state by actively changing the profile of the pump beam. Our work can be useful for applications such as novel designs of high-dimensional quantum key distribution and quantum information processing protocols. In addition, our method can be readily applied for controlling other degrees of freedom of light in the SPDC process, such as spectral and temporal properties, and may even be used in condensed-matter systems having a similar interaction Hamiltonian.

2128,WOS,Horvath & Vroom (2015),2015,Ubiquitous computer aided design: A broken promise or a Sleeping Beauty?,COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN,"As a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain-computer interfacing, cyber-physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing.

Solid-state-based quantum emitters-notably semiconductor quantum dots-are a promising candidate for the role. However, despite the remarkable progress in nanofabrication, proof-of-concept demonstrations of quantum teleportation have highlighted that imperfections of the emitter still place a major roadblock in the way of applications. Here, rather than focusing on source optimization strategies, we deal with imperfections and study different teleportation protocols with the goal of identifying the one with maximal teleportation fidelity. Using a quantum dot with sub-par values of entanglement and photon indistinguishability, we show that the average teleportation fidelity can be raised from below the classical limit to 0.842(14), adopting a polarization-selective Bell state measurement and moderate spectral filtering. Our results, which are backed by a theoretical model that quantitatively explains the experimental findings, loosen the very stringent requirements set on the ideal entangled-photon source and highlight that imperfect quantum dots can still have a say in teleportation-based quantum communication architectures.",,10.1038/s41534-020-00356-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41534-020-00356-0,Journal

In this work, we perform a detailed comparison on a level playing field between these two novel substrates by applying them to an identical challenge. We solve the sparse coding problem using the biologically inspired Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) on the D-Wave quantum annealer and Intel Loihi neuromorphic spiking processor. The Fashion-MNIST data set was chosen and dimensionallyreduced by sparse Principal Component Analysis (sPCA). A sign flipped second data set was created and appended to the original in order to give each class a mean zero distribution, effectively creating an environment where the data could not be linearly separated. An early in time normalization technique for Loihi is presented along with analysis of optimal parameter selection and unsupervised dictionary learning for all three variations.

We introduce two classes of dynamics, to be thought as templates for future investigation of LQG dynamics with the dynamics of quantum black holes in mind. The first defines global dynamics of the closure defect of the surface, with two basic toy models, either a dissipative dynamics relaxing towards the closure constraint or a Hamiltonian dynamics precessing the closure defect. The second class of dynamics describes the isolated regime, when both area and closure defect are conserved throughout the evolution. The surface dynamics is implemented through U(N) transformations and generalizes to a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with a local quadratic potential interaction.

Hydrothermal method was adopted to produce carbon quantum dots (CDs), and physically cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol hydrogel (PVA-PEG) to encapsulate CDs, which was evaluated as a lubricant for lubrication appraisal with their slow-release solution. Results of the friction experiment showed that the addition of CDs changed the structure of the gel and promoted the tribological properties of the gel. The structural characterization results show that the CDs are successfully wrapped in gel. The network cross-linked structure of the gel is improved due to the addition of CDs, which are shown by the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC). At the same time, CDs can influence the thermal stability and crystallinity of the gel as well as the degree of cross-linking. These results of TGA and DSC suggest that the curled molecular chain will not be stretched during the gel cross-linking process. After 2 h of self-healing, the recovered gel did not break again under the pull of external force.

The proposed system enables the adoption of well-developed analytical models in conventional free-space optical (FSO) communications and achieves the QKD function with a simple configuration. We analytically investigate the design criteria for transmitter and receiver, in particular, the modulation depth and the setting for dual-threshold in the context of security requirement of QKD systems. The quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the ergodic secret-key rate of the proposed system are analytically derived in closed-form expressions, considering the channel loss, atmospheric turbulence modeled by the log-normal distribution, and receiver noises. Monte-Carlo (M-C) simulations are also implemented to validate the analytical results, and numerical results confirm the feasibility of the proposed system.",,,,Conference Paper

Information theoretic security is increasingly important because of the threat of quantum computers that can effectively break algorithms and protocols that are used in today's public key infrastructure. We consider interactive protocols for wiretap II channel with active adversary who can eavesdrop and add adversarial noise to the eavesdropped part of the codeword. These channels capture wireless setting where malicious eavesdroppers at reception distance of the transmitter can eavesdrop the communication and introduce jamming signal to the channel. We derive a new upperbound R <= 1 - rho for the rate of interactive protocols over two-way wiretap II channel with active adversaries, and construct a perfectly secure protocol family with achievable rate 1 - 2 rho + rho(2). This is strictly higher than the rate of the best one round protocol which is 1 - 2 rho, hence showing that interaction improves rate. We also prove that even with interaction, reliable communication is possible only if rho < 1/2. An interesting aspect of this work is that our bounds will also hold in network setting when two nodes are connected by n paths, a rho of which is corrupted by the adversary. We discuss our results, give their relations to the other works, and propose directions for future work.",,,,Conference Paper

There are numerous challenges associated with the development of molecular simulations of fluid characteristics for industrial purposes. Fluid characteristics for industrial purposes find applications in the development of various liquid household products, such as liquid detergents, drinks, beverages, and liquid health medications, amongst others. Predicting the molecular properties of liquid pharmaceuticals or therapies to address health concerns is one of the greatest difficulties in drug development. Computational tools for precise prediction can help speed up and lower the cost of identifying new medications. A one-dimensional deep convolutional gated recurrent neural network (1D-CNN-GRU) was used in this study to offer a novel forecasting model for molecular property prediction of liquids or fluids.

A 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) was then built to extract the characteristics of the normalized molecular property of the sequence data. Furthermore, gated recurrent unit (GRU) layers processed the extracted features to extract temporal features.

The developed implementations are performed in the reversible domain to perform the required bijective parallel computing, where the implementations for parallel computations that utilize the presented field-emission controlled switching and their corresponding m-ary (many-valued) extensions for the use in nano systolic networks are introduced. The first part of the paper presents important fundamentals with regards to systolic computing and carbon-based field emission that will be utilized in the implementations within the second part of the paper. Design/methodology/approach - The introduced systolic systems utilize recent findings in field emission and nano applications to implement the functionality of the basic bijective systolic network. This includes many-valued systolic computing via field emission techniques using carbon-based nanotubes and nanotips. The realization of bijective logic circuits in current and emerging technologies can be very important for various reasons. The reduction of power consumption is a major requirement for the circuit design in future technologies, and thus, the new nano systolic circuits can play an important role in the design of circuits that consume minimal power for future applications such as in low-power signal processing. In addition, the implemented bijective systems can be utilized to implement massive parallel processing and thus obtaining very high processing performance, where the implementation will also utilize the significant size reduction within the nano domain. The extensions of implementations to field emission-based many-valued systolic networks using the introduced bijective nano systolic architectures are also presented. Findings - Novel bijective systolic architectures using nano-based field emission implementations are introduced in this paper, and the implementation using the general scheme of many-valued computing is presented. The carbon-based field emission implementation of nano systolic networks is also introduced. This is accomplished using the introduced field emission carbon-based devices, where field emission from carbon nanotubes and nano-apex carbon fibers is utilized. The implementations of the many-valued bijective systolic networks utilizing the introduced nano-based architectures are also presented. Originality/value - The introduced bijective systolic implementations form new important directions in the systolic realizations using the newly emerging nano-based technologies. The 2-to-1 multiplexer is a basic building block in switch logic, where in switch logic, a logic circuit is realized as a combination of switches rather than a combination of logic gates as in the gate logic, which proves to be less costly in synthesizing multiplexer-based wide variety of modern circuits and systems since nano implementations exist in very compact space where carbon-based devices switch reliably using much less power than silicon-based devices.

With the recent success of space-based experimental QKD systems, researchers are now focussing on implementing more practical and efficient QKD systems that meet the challenges faced in space-based implementations. One pressing problem is the need for efficient and easy to implement reconciliation schemes for practical QKD systems. Rate-adaptive schemes based on LDPC codes constitute an appealing implementation of the key reconciliation process since they cover the entire range of the channel parameter space with a limited set of pre-defined Mother codes. In this paper, we investigate in detail some rate-adaptive reconciliation schemes based on LDPC codes, illustrating how their performance compares to other set-ups in which fixed-rate non-adaptive LDPC codes optimised for different channel conditions are adopted. In particular, the impact rate-adaptive codes have on decoding complexity, and subsequently the overall secure key throughput, is quantified through full blown simulations of an entanglement-based version of the QKD protocol within the context of an entanglement source onboard a satellite. Our work highlights that even though rate-adaptive schemes schemes for QKD reconciliation appear ideal for future space-based implementations of single-photon QKD, identification of ideal Mother codes for such schemes remains to be resolved.",,,,Conference Paper
2165,WOS,Li (2019),2019,Multimodal Data Fusion with Quantum Inspiration,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 42ND INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (SIGIR '19),"Language understanding is multimodal. During human communication, messages are conveyed not only by words in textual form, but also through speech patterns, gestures or facial emotions of the speakers. Therefore, it is crucial to fuse information from different modalities to achieve a joint comprehension. With the rapid progress in the deep learning field, neural networks have emerged as the most popular approach for addressing multimodal data fusion [1, 6, 7, 12]. While these models can effectively combine multimodal features by learning from data, they nevertheless lack an explicit exhibition of how different modalities are related to each other, due to the inherent low interpretability of neural networks [2]. In the meantime, Quantum Theory (QT) has given rise to principled approaches for incorporating interactions between textual features into a holistic textual representation [3, 5, 8, 10], where the concepts of superposition and entanglement have been universally exploited to formulate interactions. The advantages of those models in capturing complicated correlations between textual features have been observed. We hereby propose the research on quantum-inspired multimodal data fusion, claiming that the limitation of multimodal data fusion can be tackled by quantum-driven models. In particular, we propose to employ superposition to formulate intra-modal interactions while the interplay between different modalities is expected to be captured by entanglement measures. By doing so, the interactions within multimodal data may be rendered explicitly in a unified quantum formalism, increasing the performance and interpretability for concrete multimodal tasks. It will also expand the application domains of quantum theory to multimodal tasks where only preliminary efforts have been made [11]. We therefore aim at answering the following research question: RQ. Can we fuse multimodal data with quantum-inspired models? To answer this question, we propose to fuse multimodal data with complex-valued neural networks, motivated by the theoretical link between neural networks and quantum theory [4] and advances in complex-valued neural networks [9]. Our model begins with a separate complex-valued embedding learned for each unimodal data based on the existing works [5, 10], which inherently assumes superposition between intra-modal features. Then we construct a many-body system in entangled state for multimodal data, where cross-modality interactions are naturally reflected by entanglement measures. Quantum measurement operators are applied to the entanglement state to address a concrete multimodal task at hand. The whole process is instrumented by a complex-valued neural network, which is able to learn how multimodal features are combined from data, and at the same time explain the combination by means of quantum superposition and entanglement measures. We plan to examine our proposed models on CMU-MOSI [12] and CMU-MOSEI [1], which are benchmarking multimodal sentiment analysis datasets. The dataset targets at classifying sentiment into 2, 5 or 7 classes with the input of textual, visual and acoustic features. We expect to see comparable effectiveness to state-of-the-art models, and we will explore superposition and entanglement measures to better understand the inter-modal interactions.",,10.1145/3331184.3331419,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331419,Conference Paper

Traditional studies based on density functional theory (DFT) in physics are proved to be time-consuming for predicting large number of molecules. Recently, the machine learning methods, which consider much rule-based information, have also shown potentials for this issue. However, the complex inherent quantum interactions of molecules are still largely underexplored by existing solutions. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and transferable Multilevel Graph Convolutional neural Network (MGCN) for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we represent each molecule as a graph to preserve its internal structure. Moreover, the well-designed hierarchical graph neural network directly extracts features from the conformation and spatial information followed by the multilevel interactions. As a consequence, the multilevel overall representations can be utilized to make the prediction. Extensive experiments on both datasets of equilibrium and off-equilibrium molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, the detailed results also prove that MGCN is generalizable and transferable for the prediction.",,,,Conference Paper

The atomic layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit intrinsic CP emissions and are potential chiroptical materials for ultrathin CP photon sources. In this work, we demonstrated CP photon sources of TMDCs with device thicknesses approximately 50 nm. CP photoluminescence from the atomic layers of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) was precisely controlled with chiral metamolecules (MMs), and the optical chirality of WSe2 was enhanced more than 4 times by integrating with the MMs. Both the enhanced and reversed circular dichroisms had been achieved. Through integrations of the novel gain material and plasmonic structure which are both low-dimensional, a compact device capable of efficiently manipulating emissions of CP photon was realized. These ultrathin devices are suitable for important applications such as the optical information technology and chip-scale biosensing.",,10.1021/acsami.8b01472,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b01472,Journal

The multi-user network performance can be enhanced via MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) technology to get the maximum secure key rates due to the less insertion loss and crosstalk for switching operation. We have analyzed a four-state, quadrature-phase shift keying (QPSK) transmitter to generate quantum keys, i.e. Alice, while a classical coherent receiver aided by the digital post-processing unit is being used as Bob. To route the secure QKD traffic to the end-users, 1x2, 1x4, 1x8 and 1x12 switching configurations have been analyzed for the transmission distance ranging from 0 to 60 km. We have achieved the secure key rates of 30 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s for the 1x12 and 1x2 switching configurations, respectively. We have also compared the performance of routed QKD traffic with a simple point-to-point QKD system and the classical DV-QKD protocol. The QKD networks need an effective low-loss fibre channel and a distribution system to enhance the transmission distance of the secure keys and applications.

As an important means ofquantum precision measurement, interferometer precision measurement technology has great application valuein quantum communication. The linear interferometer measures the magnitude of the physical quantity byusing the phase change obtained from the measurements, but measurement accuracy is limited and unable tomeet the requirements of today's scientific problems for the precision measurement of some physical quantities.On this basis, nonlinear interferometer is able to take advantage of the quantum entangled state, that is, usingthe two light fields of quantum correlation characteristics to realize quantum enhanced precision measurement,thus greatly improving the measurement sensitivity, Therefore, the scope of application is wider, but thepreparation of quantum entangled states has many limitations in practical manipulation. With the maturity ofexperimental conditions and technology, how to use both of these interferometers to further improve themeasurement accuracy of the phase signal so as to break the limitation to shot noise, breaking the standardquantum limit and even approaching to the Heisenberg limit has become a frontier research topic . In thispaper, we introduce several methods to improve the accuracy of parameter evaluation in the measurementprocess by using linear (including an atomic/photon interferometer) and nonlinear interferometer to callquantum resources at different stages. High-precision measurement can be achieved by inputting non-classicalstates into the interferometer, such as compressed state, bi-fock state, and NOON state. And we also introducethe weak measurement developed for the direct observation of quantum states and its application to non-Hermitian systems, and the multiparameter measurement proposed to eliminate the accuracy balance betweenparameters. Compared with the first two measurement methods, weak measurement method is based on theweak value amplification principle of an indirect measurement. Measurements are performed virtually withoutperturbing the quantum system, which does not lead the wave function to collapse, the weak value of the realand virtual part have different physical significance, The combination of weak measurement theory and non-Hermitian system also further improves the measurement sensitivity. Multi-parameter measurement usesquantum entanglement, quantum control and other quantum resources to make the measurement progress reachthe Heisenberg limit, which is the current research hotspot in the field of precision measurement. Furthermore,we present a conjecture whether there will be multi-atomic mixing measurements based on atomic spin effectsor ultra-high sensitivity measurement instruments with precision of fT or even aT by using other particlesdetection.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification.

However, it is still a great challenge in cryptography communications, where it is greatly weakened by the openness of the light channels. Here, visible-infrared dual-mode narrowband perovskite photodetectors were fabricated and a new photo-communication encryption technique was proposed. For the first time, highly narrowband and two-photon absorption (TPA) resultant photoresponses within a single photodetector are demonstrated. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the photoresponse is as narrow as 13.6 nm in the visible range, which is superior to state-of-the-art narrowband photodetectors. Furthermore, these two merits of narrowband and TPA characteristics are utilized to encrypt the photo-communication based on the above photodetectors. When sending information and noise signals with 532 and 442 nm laser light simultaneously, the perovskite photodetectors only receive the main information, while the commercial Si photodetector responds to both lights, losing the main information completely. The final data are determined by the secret key through the TPA process as preset. Such narrowband and TPA detection abilities endow the perovskite photodetectors with great potential in future security communication and also provide new opportunities and platforms for encryption techniques.",,10.1039/c7nr06193e,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7nr06193e,Journal

However, implementing energy-efficient and large-scale systems remains elusive because commonly used programmable photonic approaches are volatile and energy-hungry. Recent results on nonvolatile phase-change material (PCM) integrated photonics present a promising opportunity to create truly programmable photonics. The ability to drastically change the refractive index of the PCMs in a nonvolatile fashion allows creating programmable units with zero-static energy. By taking advantage of the electrical control, nonvolatile reconfiguration, and zero crosstalk between each unit, PCMs can enable extra largescale integrated (ELSI) photonics. In this Perspective, we briefly review the recent progress in PCM photonics and discuss the challenges and limitations of this emerging technology. We argue that energy efficiency is a more critical parameter than the operating speed for programmable photonics, making PCMs an ideal candidate. This has the potential for a disruptive paradigm shift in the reconfigurable photonics research philosophy, as slow but energy-efficient and large index modulation can provide a better solution for ELSI photonics than fast but power-hungry, small index tuning methods. We also highlight the exciting opportunities to leverage wide bandgap PCMs for visible-wavelength applications, such as quantum photonics and optogenetics, and for rewritable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) using nanosecond pulsed lasers. The latter can dramatically reduce the fabrication cost of PICs and democratize the PIC manufacturing process for rapid prototyping.",,10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00976,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00976,Journal

PSLC composite was prepared using a nematic liquid crystal (E63) and Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer. In order to improve physical properties, composites were dispersed with different concentration of CdSeS/ZnS QD. The electro-optical and dielectric properties of the composites were investigated depending on the frequency and voltage. Considerable physical parameters such as threshold voltage, dielectric anisotropy, relaxation frequency and response time were obtained from the experimental data. The results show that QD contribution and polymer networks change the electro-optical and dielectric properties of PSLC and these can become a focus of interest for new applications of PSLC composites in the future.

QCA designs, which are best suited to replace CMOS technique, are more interesting among the other techniques because of its attractive features of high speed operation, ultra-low power consumption and small dimension utilizing very less overall area. In this presentation, novel designs and layout of code converters like Binary to Gray and Gray to Binary have been implemented for 4-bit level which are a crucial code converters required at almost all the communication devices. Energy estimation and verification of the outputs for the proposed converter designs have been obtained using QCAPro and QCADesigner tool respectively, which shows the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

(2021),2021,Coherence in single photon emission from droplet epitaxy and Stranski-Krastanov quantum dots in the telecom C-band,APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS,"The ability of two photons to interfere lies at the heart of many photonic quantum networking concepts and requires that the photons are indistinguishable with sufficient coherence times to resolve the interference signals. However, for solid-state quantum light sources, this can be challenging to achieve as they are in constant interaction with noise sources in their environment. Here, we investigate the noise sources that affect InAs/InP quantum dots emitting in the telecom C-band by comparing their behavior on a wetting layer for Stranski-Krastanov grown quantum dots with a nearly wetting layer-free environment achieved with the droplet epitaxy growth mode. We show that the droplet epitaxy growth mode is beneficial for a quiet environment, leading to 96% of exciton transitions having a coherence time longer than the typical detector resolution of 100 ps, even under non-resonant excitation. We also show that the decay profile indicates the presence of slow dephasing processes, which can be compensated for experimentally. We finally conduct Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements between subsequently emitted photons and find a corrected two-photon interference visibility of 98.6 +/- 1.6% for droplet-epitaxy grown quantum dots. The understanding of the influence of their surroundings on the quantum optical properties of these emitters is important for their optimization and use in future quantum networking applications.",,10.1063/5.0032128,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0032128,Journal

(2015),2015,Experimental quantum key distribution with simulated ground-to-satellite photon losses and processing limitations,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) has the potential to improve communications security by offering cryptographic keys whose security relies on the fundamental properties of quantum physics. The use of a trusted quantum receiver on an orbiting satellite is the most practical near-term solution to the challenge of achieving long-distance (global-scale) QKD, currently limited to a few hundred kilometers on the ground. This scenario presents unique challenges, such as high photon losses and restricted classical data transmission and processing power due to the limitations of a typical satellite platform. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of such a system by implementing a QKD protocol, with optical transmission and full post-processing, in the high-loss regime using minimized computing hardware at the receiver. Employing weak coherent pulses with decoy states, we demonstrate the production of secure key bits at up to 56.5 dB of photon loss. We further illustrate the feasibility of a satellite uplink by generating a secure key while experimentally emulating the varying losses predicted for realistic low-Earth-orbit satellite passes at 600 km altitude. With a 76 MHz source and including finite-size analysis, we extract 3374 bits of a secure key from the best pass. We also illustrate the potential benefit of combining multiple passes together: while one suboptimal upper-quartile pass produces no finite-sized key with our source, the combination of three such passes allows us to extract 165 bits of a secure key. Alternatively, we find that by increasing the signal rate to 300 MHz it would be possible to extract 21 570 bits of a secure finite-sized key in just a single upper-quartile pass.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.92.052339,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.92.052339,Journal

Therefore, substantial efforts and progress have been made to attain superior design/engineering and optimization of the inorganic NCs with a focus on surface quality, reduced nonradiative charge carrier recombination centers, and improved colloidal stabilities. Metal-ion doping has been proven to have a robust influence on the electronic band structure, PL behavior, and charge carrier recombination dynamics. Thus, in this perspective, we summarize the recent progress of the significant impact of metal cation doping on the optical properties, including the PL enhancement of CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 perovskite NCs. Moreover, we shed light on the mechanism behind such improved properties.

Here we propose to implement an antiferromagnetic model through optoelectronic correlation computing with SPIM. Also we exploit the gauge transformation which enables encoding the spins and the interaction strengths in a single phase-only spatial light modulator. With a simple setup, we experimentally show the ground-state-search acceleration of an antiferromagnetic model with 40000 spins in number-partitioning problem. Thus such an optoelectronic computing exhibits great programmability and scalability for the practical applications of studying statistical systems and combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs), a variant of optical Ising machines, are promising for large-scale problems but have limitations on the type of problems that can be mapped on them.

In this paper, we present a hybrid logical qubit entanglement purification protocol (HLEPP) that can distill one copy of high-quality HLES from two same low-quality copies. This HLEPP can directly purify the bit-flip errors occurring in the polarization part, the coherent state part, and the logical qubit, respectively.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CDs at low concentration showed an excitation-independent behaviour, which is very different from the previous reports. Two different emitting mechanisms might work: the intrinsic luminescence from sp(2)-carbon networks can be responsible for the shorter wavelength part of emission (excitation-independent) at low concentration and the high polarity of nanosized clusters led to the excitation-dependent behaviour of the longer wavelength part at high concentration of CD solution. The photophysical property and concentration-dependent behaviour of the CDs offered new insights into CDs from the viewpoints of both experiments and mechanisms, which will promote diverse potential applications of CDs in the near future.",,10.1186/s11671-017-2137-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s11671-017-2137-2,Journal

Then, the effect of the signal wavelength, pump power and amplifier length on the saturation characteristics is numerically simulated. The obtained results show that the proposed model is in a good agreement with the previous experimental results.

The nearsightedness of electronic matter  is exploited to define monomers as natural building blocks  on the basis of their distinct chemical identity. The energy of generic molecules is then expressed as a sum of individual many-body energies of incrementally larger subsystems. The MB-nrg PEFs represent the low-order n-body energies, with n = 1-4, using permutationally invariant polynomials derived from electronic structure data carried out at an arbitrary quantum mechanical level of theory, while all higher-order n-body terms (n > 4) are represented by a classical many-body polarization term. As a proof-of-concept application of the general MB-nrg framework, we present MB-nrg PEFs for linear alkanes. The MB-nrg PEFs are shown to accurately reproduce reference energies, harmonic frequencies, and potential energy scans of alkanes, independently of their length. Since, by construction, the MB-nrg framework introduced here can be applied to generic covalently bonded molecules, we envision future computer simulations of complex molecular systems using data-driven MB-nrg PEFs, with arbitrary quantum mechanical accuracy.",,10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00645,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00645,Journal

Pinning down exactly which quantum phenomena are responsible for this has proved to be a tricky and controversial question, but a lot of progress has been made in the past few decades. We now have a range of precise statements showing that whatever the ultimate laws of nature are, they cannot be classical. In this article, we review results on the fundamental phenomena of quantum theory that cannot be understood in classical terms. We proceed by first granting quite a broad notion of classicality, describe a range of quantum phenomena (such as randomness, discreteness, the indistinguishability of states, measurement-uncertainty, measurement-disturbance, complementarity, non-commutativity, interference, the no-cloning theorem and the collapse of the wave-packet) that do fall under its liberal scope, and then finally describe some aspects of quantum physics that can never admit a classical understanding - the intrinsically quantum mechanical aspects of nature. The most famous of these is Bell's theorem, but we also review two more recent results in this area. Firstly, Hardy's theorem shows that even a finite-dimensional quantum system must contain an infinite amount of information, and secondly, the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem shows that the wave function must be an objective property of an individual quantum system.

Originally introduced to study the key-distribution problem, semi-quantum research has since expanded, and continues to grow, with new protocols, security proof methods, experimental implementations, and new cryptographic applications beyond key distribution. Research in the field of semi-quantum cryptography requires new insights into working with restricted protocols and, so, the tools and techniques derived in this field can translate to results in broader quantum information science. Furthermore, other questions such as the connection between quantum and classical processing, including how classical information processing can be used to counteract a quantum deficiency in a protocol, can shed light on important theoretical questions. This work surveys the history and current state of the art in semi-quantum research. We discuss the model and several protocols offering the reader insight into how protocols are constructed in this realm. We discuss security proof methods and how classical post-processing can be used to counteract users' inability to perform certain quantum operations. Moving beyond key distribution, we survey current work in other semi-quantum cryptographic protocols and current trends. We also survey recent work done in attempting to construct practical semi-quantum systems including recent experimental results in this field.

More importantly, the encapsulated CsPbBr3 PQDs composite shows a good long-term stability against the external environment, such as water, methanol and UV light irradiation, which is of great significance for its practical application. Furthermore, the embedded CsPbBr3 PQDs are shown to be easily released from the copolymer matrix, which is very important for making all-solution-processed devices. Finally, a white light-emitting diode with a high luminous efficiency of 90 lm/W was successfully demonstrated based on these high-brightness CsPbBr3 PQDs@PDPEP-co-S phosphors, which indicates its promising potential in future illumination applications.",,10.1016/j.cej.2020.124180,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124180,Journal

Tensor product structure of history-dependent correlations was also recently exploited as a quantum computing resource in simple linear optical setups performing multiplane diffraction (MPD) of fermionic and bosonic particles with remarkable promises. This significantly motivates the definition of quantum histories of MPD as entanglement resources with the inherent capability of generating an exponentially increasing number of Feynman paths through diffraction planes in a scalable manner and experimental low complexity combining the utilization of coherent light sources and photon-counting detection. In this article, quantum temporal correlation and interference among MPD paths are denoted with quantum path entanglement (QPE) and interference (QPI), respectively, as novel quantum resources. Operator theory modeling of QPE and counterintuitive properties of QPI are presented by combining history-based formulations with Feynman's path integral approach. Leggett-Garg inequality as temporal analog of Bell's inequality is violated for MPD with all signaling constraints in the ambiguous form recently formulated by Emary.

The need for empirical knowledge arises because any reasonably complete exploration of the potential energy surfaces (PES) of organic reactions is computationally prohibitive. We have previously introduced the heuristically-aided quantum chemistry (HAQC) approach to modeling complex chemical reactions, which abstracts the empirical knowledge in terms of chemical heuristics simple rules guiding the PES exploration and combines them with structure optimizations using quantum chemical methods. The HAQC approach makes use of heuristic kinetic criteria for selecting reaction paths that are not only plausible, that is, consistent with the empirical rules of organic reactivity, but also feasible under the reaction conditions. In this work, we develop heuristic kinetic feasibility criteria, which correctly predict feasible reaction pathways for a wide range of simple polar (substitutions, additions, and eliminations) and pericyclic organic reactions (cyclizations, sigmatropic shifts, and cycloadditions). In contrast to knowledge-based reaction mechanism prediction methods, the same kinetic heuristics are successful in classifying reaction pathways as feasible or infeasible across this diverse set of reaction mechanisms.

2211,WOS,Hensen et al. (2015),2015,Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres,NATURE,"More than 50 years ago(1), John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism(2) can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory: in any local-realist theory, the correlations between outcomes of measurements on distant particles satisfy an inequality that can be violated if the particles are entangled. Numerous Bell inequality tests have been reported(3-13); however, all experiments reported so far required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in 'loopholes'(13-16). Here we report a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We use an event-ready scheme(17-19) that enables the generation of robust entanglement between distant electron spins (estimated state fidelity of 0.92 +/- 0.03). Efficient spin read-out avoids the fair-sampling assumption (detection loophole(14,15)), while the use of fast random-basis selection and spin read-out combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 kilometres ensure the required locality conditions(13). We performed 245 trials that tested the CHSH-Bell inequality(20) S <= 2 and found S = 2.42 +/- 0.20 (where S quantifies the correlation between measurement outcomes). A null-hypothesis test yields a probability of at most P = 0.039 that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites could produce data with a violation at least as large as we observe, even when allowing for memory(16,21) in the devices. Our data hence imply statistically significant rejection of the local-realist null hypothesis. This conclusion may be further consolidated in future experiments; for instance, reaching a value of P = 0.001 would require approximately 700 trials for an observed S = 2.4. With improvements, our experiment could be used for testing less-conventional theories, and for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication(22) and randomness certification(23,24).",,10.1038/nature15759,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature15759,Journal

2213,WOS,Kaushal & Kaddoum (2017),2017,Applications of Lasers for Tactical Military Operations,IEEE ACCESS,"Laser technology has observed a great advancement over the last few decades. This technology is used for a wide range of applications including medical sciences, military, industrial manufacturing, electronics, holography, spectroscopy, astronomy and much more. Military operations often demand a secure and timely transmission of a massive amount of information from one place to another. Until now, the military has relied on the radio spectrum for effective communication, which is vulnerable to security threats and susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Also, this spectrum is hard-pressed to meet the current bandwidth requirement for high-resolution images, on-air video conferencing and real-time data transfer. Therefore, the focus has shifted to visible and infrared spectrum using laser technology which is capable of providing secure data transfer because of its immunity to EMI. The probability of intercepting a laser signal is very low due to its narrow beam divergence and coherent optical beam, making the laser a suitable candidate for secure military tactical operations. Besides the communication aspect, the highly directive nature of a laser beam is also used as a directed energy laser weapon. These highly powerful and light weighted directed energy laser weapons are very cost-effective countermeasures for airborne threats. Furthermore, laser sensors are deployed in the battlefield or in space for tracking the path of a wide range of military vehicles like missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, fighter aircraft, warships, submarines, and so on. Advancements in space operations and laser technology have offered synergistic possibilities of using lasers from space-based platforms during military operations. In this paper, we are providing our readers with a comprehensive study of laser applications, used by the military, to carry out tactical operations on the ground or space-based platforms.

2214,WOS,Danesh & Rahman (2017),2017,A New Approach for Multi-Valued Computing Using Machine Learning,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REBOOTING COMPUTING (ICRC),"To continue scaling in future and to meet emerging application requirements, revolutionary concepts are required not just on how can we find better switches to implement computers, but also on how computers compute logic. Multi-Valued Logic (MVL) provides one such opportunity, since efficient implementation of MVL can allow compact and enhanced information processing and be orders of magnitude efficient than binary CMOS. Emerging devices such as Quantum Dots, Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), Carbon Nanotube FETs (CNTFETs), Spin Wave Devices etc., provide an avenue for hardware implementation of MVL. So far, MVL lagged behind CMOS due to (a) complexities associated with traditional logic decomposition approaches, which result in many MVL minterms, complex polynomials of order greater than two, and cumbersome decision diagrams that are difficult to implement, and (b) multi-valued data representation, processing and communication using binary switches and medium, which are inefficient. In this paper, we propose a transformative new direction for multi-valued logic decomposition (problem (a)) utilizing concepts from machine learning and nanoelectronics. In our approach, given a MVL function, we perform iterative linear regressions on all input and output combinations to derive a set of linear expressions. A visual pattern matching technique is then applied to derive selection conditions for each linear expression based on the function inputs. The set of linear expressions and corresponding selection criteria ensure that for all function inputs, correct outputs are obtained. The resulting linear expressions are hardware implementation friendly and can be implemented with simple gates and summation functions. In this paper, we show an approach to solve (b) by implementing a quaternary multiplier using our technique. Our detailed comparison with existing methods suggests huge benefits can be attained with the proposed method.",,,,Conference Paper

Here the proposed phonon blockade is based on the nonlinearity of system induced by the strong spin-mechanical coupling. Our approach involves introducing an ancillary quadratic optomechanical coupling (i.e., the cavity field quadratically coupled to mechanical motion) and simultaneously considering the cavity field with a single photon. By injecting the auxiliary photons, one can not only enhance the spin-resonator interaction, but also realize fully switchable phonon blockade. This work offers an approach to manipulate phonon statistics with photons, which should inspire the engineering of new single-phonon quantum devices and have potential applications in the future hybrid photon-phonon quantum networks.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.99.013804,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.013804,Journal

Using a method based on the decomposition of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the unitary infinite-dimensional representations of SL(2,C) in terms of those of SU(2), we are able to provide for the first time numerical evaluations of the vertex amplitude. The values obtained support the asymptotic formula obtained by Barrett and collaborators with a saddle point approximation, showing, in particular, a power-law decay and oscillations related to the Regge action. The comparison offers a test of the efficiency of the method. Truncating the decomposition to the first few terms provides a qualitative matching of the power-law decay and oscillations. For vector and Euclidean Regge boundary data, a qualitative matching is obtained with just the first term, which corresponds to the simplified EPRL model. We comment on future developments for the numerics and extension to higher vertices. We complete our work with some analytic results: We provide an algorithm and explicit configurations for the different geometries that can arise as boundary data, and explain the geometric consequences of the decomposition used.",,10.1103/PhysRevD.100.106003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.106003,Journal

Here in this work, the performances of atmospheric continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD) under diverse weather conditions are analyzed quantitatively. According to the Mie scattering theory and atmospheric CV-MDI-QKD model, we numerically simulate the relationship between performance of CV-MDI-QKD and the rainy and foggy conditions, aiming to get close to the actual combat environment in the future. The results show that both rain and fog will degrade the performance of the CV-MDI-QKD protocol. Under the rainy condition, the larger the raindrop diameter, the more obvious the extinction effect is and the lower the secret key rate accordingly. In addition, we find that the secret key rate decreases with the increase of spot deflection distance and the fluctuation of deflection. Under the foggy condition, the results illustrate that the transmittance decreases with the increase of droplet radius or deflection distance, which eventually yields the decrease in the secret key rate. Besides, in both weather conditions, the increase of transmission distance also leads the secret key rate to deteriorate. Our work can provide a foundation for evaluating the performance evaluation and successfully implementing the atmospheric CV-MDI-QKD in the future field operation environment under different weather conditions.",,10.1088/1674-1056/ab5efd,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-1056/ab5efd,Journal

Here, we focus on the TF-QKD type protocol proposed by Curty et al (2019 NPJ Quantum Inf. 5 64), which can provide a high secret key rate and whose practical feasibility has been demonstrated in various recent experiments. The security of this protocol relies on the estimation of certain detection probabilities (yields) through the decoy-state technique. Analytical bounds on the relevant yields have been recently derived assuming that both parties use the same set of decoy intensities, thus providing sub-optimal key rates in asymmetric-loss scenarios. Here we derive new analytical bounds when the parties use either two, three or four independent decoy intensity settings each. With the new bounds we optimize the protocol?s performance in asymmetric-loss scenarios and show that the protocol is robust against uncorrelated intensity fluctuations affecting the parties? lasers.",,10.1088/1367-2630/ab520e,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ab520e,Journal

Such behavior has primarily been observed in disordered systems. More recently, experimental and theoretical evidence for athermal eigenstates, known as quantum scars, has emerged in nonintegrable disorder-free models in one dimension with constrained dynamics. In this Rapid Communication, we show the existence of quantum scar eigenstates and investigate their dynamical properties in many simple two-body Hamiltonians with staggered interactions, involving ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic motifs, in arbitrary dimensions. These magnetic models include simple modifications of widely studied ones (e.g., the XXZ model) on a variety of frustrated and unfrustrated lattices. We demonstrate our ideas by focusing on the two-dimensional frustrated spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet, which was previously shown to harbor a special exactly solvable point with three-coloring ground states in its phase diagram. For appropriately chosen initial product states-for example, those which correspond to any state of valid three-colors-we show the presence of robust quantum revivals, which survive the addition of anisotropic terms.

(2021),2021,Computational Infrared Spectroscopy of 958 Phosphorus-Bearing Molecules,FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES,"Phosphine is now well-established as a biosignature, which has risen to prominence with its recent tentative detection on Venus. To follow up this discovery and related future exoplanet biosignature detections, it is important to spectroscopically detect the presence of phosphorus-bearing atmospheric molecules that could be involved in the chemical networks producing, destroying or reacting with phosphine. We start by enumerating phosphorus-bearing molecules (P-molecules) that could potentially be detected spectroscopically in planetary atmospheres and collecting all available spectral data. Gaseous P-molecules are rare, with speciation information scarce. Very few molecules have high accuracy spectral data from experiment or theory; instead, the best current spectral data was obtained using a high-throughput computational algorithm, RASCALL, relying on functional group theory to efficiently produce approximate spectral data for arbitrary molecules based on their component functional groups. Here, we present a high-throughput approach utilizing established computational quantum chemistry methods (CQC) to produce a database of approximate infrared spectra for 958 P-molecules. These data are of interest for astronomy and astrochemistry (importantly identifying potential ambiguities in molecular assignments), improving RASCALL's underlying data, big data spectral analysis and future machine learning applications. However, this data will probably not be sufficiently accurate for secure experimental detections of specific molecules within complex gaseous mixtures in laboratory or astronomy settings. We chose the strongly performing harmonic omega B97X-D/def2-SVPD model chemistry for all molecules and test the more sophisticated and time-consuming GVPT2 anharmonic model chemistry for 250 smaller molecules. Limitations to our automated approach, particularly for the less robust GVPT2 method, are considered along with pathways to future improvements. Our CQC calculations significantly improve on existing RASCALL data by providing quantitative intensities, new data in the fingerprint region (crucial for molecular identification) and higher frequency regions (overtones, combination bands), and improved data for fundamental transitions based on the specific chemical environment. As the spectroscopy of most P-molecules have never been studied outside RASCALL and this approach, the new data in this paper is the most accurate spectral data available for most P-molecules and represent a significant advance in the understanding of the spectroscopic behavior of these molecules.",,10.3389/fspas.2021.639068,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2021.639068,Journal

Some quantum key distribution protocols have absolute (theoretical and informational) stability, but quantum secure direct communication (deterministic) protocols have only asymptotic stability. For a whole class of methods to ensure Q-trit deterministic quantum cryptography protocols stability, reliable trit generation method is required. In this paper, authors have developed a high-speed and secure pseudorandom number (PRN) generation method. This method includes the following steps: initialization of the internal state vector and direct PRN generation.

As such, an accurate representation of proton dynamics under confinement is important for understanding and predicting charge storage dynamics in these materials.

Although overall NQEs are relatively small, especially in bulk, we find that they can alter both quantitative values and qualitative trends on both proton transport and water self-diffusion under confinement relative to classical MD predictions.

However, the continuous exponential growth of available information has already triggered an uprising demand on data-scientists, supposed to organize and extract the statistically valid outcomes for the present and future use. From the other side, the request to increase the collaboration among different scientific fields led people towards an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach, both terms of actual research and the student education.

While at a long propagation distance, evolution properties of polarization in horizontal paths of turbulent atmosphere differs much from those in free space and in slant paths.

(2019),2019,LCTs 6 years operations: more than 25.000 successful optical links,2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (IEEE ICSOS),"Laser Communication Terminals (LCTs) became commercial units and proved the quality and capabilities of optical communications. TESAT's LCTs have successfully accomplished more than 25.000 links in the past six years. In this paper, an overview of the results generated during this time is presented. Eight LCTs 135, 1064 nm wavelength are/have been in operation in the past six years. Two LC Ts are on board of gcostationary satellites (GD)s) and six are/were on board of low-orbit satellites (LE0s) covering wide range of missions from earth observation (e.g. Copernicus program) and surveillance to technology demonstrator payloads (e.g. TDP1 Experimentation Program) [1] [2]. Space to ground links (SGI.$) have been demonstrated using different art of optical ground stations (OGS). Up- and down-optical links with and without communication between the Technology Demonstrator Payload 1 (TDP1) and the DLR Transportable Adaptive Optics Ground Station (T-AOGS) [121 have been used for experimental purpose, contributing to the data generation for atmospheric modelling and supporting the experts in building a better understanding of atmospheric impact onto the optical channel [31. In order to implement and operate the LCTs, new operational concepts have been developed. Generation of operational products like link requests or commanding files has been supported and tuned [51 [21. Further technology applications like airborne terminals are currently under validation. In 2019, several companies have started the verification of their terminals using the E2E test bed TDP1 and the T-AOGS described in [4]. Testing campaigns are ongoing in 2019. The TDP1 test bed has also supported quantum key distribution (QKD) verifications [7] [13] and optical channel characterization [91. Methods for analysis, characterization and assessment of trends and performances of the LCTs in space and OGS have been developed and implemented. The Long Term Performance Analysis (LTPA) enables the assessment of potential degradations and allows for an introduction of corresponding counter measures (i.e. parameter settings modifications) preventing from negative impact on operations and services [61 [10]. The knowledge gained from the TDP1 Program has been an important contribution to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). [8]",,,,Conference Paper

However, the development of high-efficiency and wavelength-tunable NIR nanomaterials is still a challenge. Herein, a series of lanthanide ions doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 double perovskite nanocrystals (DPNCs) with wavelength-tunable NIR light emission (800-1600 nm) have been synthesized. The optimal photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the DPNCs reaches 66.7%, which is a record value for DPNCs. It is mainly attributed to the contribution of NIR emission of lanthanide ions doped into DPNCs. More importantly, the series of NIR emission wavelengths of lanthanide ions doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 DPNCs include not only shorter-wavelength NIR light (& LE;900 nm) but also longer-wavelength NIR light (> 900 nm), which are more appropriate for foodstuff analysis and medical diagnosis applications. Furthermore, 11.2% Nd3+ doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 DPNCs with the optimal PLQY were embedded in a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer matrix (DPNCs@PMMA), and the stability of DPNCs modified by PMMA has been greatly improved. Finally, the 11.2% Nd3+ ions doped Cs2AgIn0.99Bi0.01Cl6 DPNCs@PMMA based NIR LEDs have demonstrated good night vision and human tissue penetration. This work indicates that lanthanide ions doped DPNCs have a potential in NIR light applications and could inspire future research to explore novel lanthanide ions doped semiconductor NCs based NIR LEDs.",,10.1021/acsami.2c10350,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c10350,Journal

In the past few decades, metasurfaces have drawn broad interests in multidisciplinary communities owing to their capability of manipulating various parameters of the light wave with plentiful functionalities. Among them, pixelated polarization manipulation in the subwavelength scale is a distinguished ability of metasurfaces compared to traditional optical components. However, the inherent ohmic loss of plasmonic-type metasurfaces severely hinders their broad applications due to the low efficiency. Therefore, metasurfaces composed of high-refractive-index all-dielectric antennas have been proposed to achieve high-efficiency devices. Moreover, anisotropic dielectric nanostructures have been shown to support large refractive index contrast between orthogonal polarizations of light and thus provide an ideal platform for polarization manipulation. Herein, we present a review of recent progress on all-dielectric meta surfaces for polarization manipulation, including principles and emerging applications. We believe that high efficient all-dielectric metasurfaces with the unprecedented capability of the polarization control can be widely applied in areas of polarization detection and imaging, data encryption, display, optical communication and quantum optics to realize ultracompact and miniaturized optical systems.",,10.1515/nanoph-2020-0220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/nanoph-2020-0220,Journal

(2022),2022,Light-switchable quasi-BIC optical vortex generators,ACTIVE PHOTONIC PLATFORMS 2022,"Optical vortices, the spatial modes of an electromagnetic wave carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), have attracted increasing interest because of their potential for applications in optical communication with enhanced security and channel capacity. A unique optical vortex (OV) generation method has been recently proposed based on the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase induced by the winding topology of polarization around a vortex singularity at bound states in the continuum (BIC). Compared with the recently emergent metasurface-based OV generators, which rely on spatial variations, the BIC-based OV generators have yielded advances in terms of design feasibility, fabrication complexity, and robustness. However, their applications in practical photonic systems are currently limited because OV generations from BIC-related devices originate from the topological property of the photonic bands and cannot be dynamically altered. Here, by leveraging the vortex topology in momentum space together with the nonlinear dynamics of silicon, we demonstrate that a silicon photonic crystal slab can realize optically switchable OV generation. In particular, the spatial tunability and the switching effects in the picosecond scale are studied using nonlinear modeling at near-infrared wavelengths. The demonstrated nontrivial topological nature of the active generators can expand the application of BIC-based devices to include ultrafast vortex beam generation, high-capacity optical communication, and mode-division multiplexing.",,10.1117/12.2632656,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2632656,Conference Paper

An emerging paradigm is to complement the existing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology with new functionalities, rather than finding a drop-in replacement for it. In this article, we discuss such a complementary approach that we call probabilistic spin logic (PSL) based on the concept of a probabilistic or p-bit. p-bits fluctuate between 0 and 1 and can be imagined in between deterministic bits that are either 0 or 1 and quantum bits that are a superposition of 0 and 1. Interconnected circuits built out of p-bits (p-circuits) can be broadly useful for machine learning and quantum computing in the solution of problems that conventional CMOS may not be particularly suited for. Although such p-bits can be implemented using standard CMOS technology, we will show that the inherent physics of nanomagnets can naturally provide an energy efficient and scalable p-bit implementation through the use of low-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). In this article, we provide a general description of p-bits and p-circuits and discuss their applications. We review experimental progress toward constructing p-bits and p-circuits exploiting the inherent stochasticity of nanomagnets, from a physics/device/circuits perspective. In particular, we identify building blocks for write and read operations that can be used in different combinations to construct functional p-bits and p-circuits.

Conceptual skills are being enhanced through the use of interactive mapping techniques connected to online resources. The ability to see connections with data and relate it to trends analysis is a key aspect in utilizing Big Data. Coupled with the rise of Big Data is also the development of faster computing systems which can collate and summarize data queries initiated by the enduser. The age of quantum computers whereby searching techniques will be accelerated beyond current abilities of the processing speeds of traditional digital processors will necessitate different ways to display information and analyze it. Natural language and semantic search strategies, search engine advancements and AI developments are introducing newer approaches to data analysis. By using both search techniques formulated by humans and combining them with results obtained from machine assisted learning a new era of information access has evolved. Finding information using newer cognitive based modeling systems to help retrieve information as well as understanding the growth of data will be outlined. Visual demonstrations of new information modeling systems will be discussed and the implications of accessing data for the eventual solutions to complex problems will also be discussed. The rate of change in knowledge accumulation necessitates that search strategies be fluid and generative in their design rather than static or sequential. Knowledge management also needs to be integrated with a dynamic structure with search strategy designs, which can constantly utilize newer forms of data analysis. The preparation and planning for installing a progressive knowledge based management and acquisition system in educational institutions needs to be deployed sooner rather than later so as to better prepare the next generation of Thai students entering the newly formed ASAEN community.

The scalable top-down fabrication process involves the use of self-assembled ferritin bio-templates as the etch mask, spin coated on top of a strained In0.3Ga0.7N/GaN single quantum well (SQW) structure, followed by a neutral beam etch (NBE) method. The small dimensions of the iron cores inside ferritin and nearly damage-free process enabled by the NBE jointly contribute to the observation of photoluminescence (PL) from strain-relaxed In0.3Ga0.7N/GaN QDs at 6 K. The large blueshift of the peak wavelength by over 70 nm manifests a strong reduction of the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) within the QD structure, which also agrees well with the theoretical prediction using a 3D Schrodinger equation solver.

These technologies that emanated from the Quantum 1.0 Revolution have become ubiquitous in modern civilization over the past 50 years. The product commercialization and mass production were enabled by scientists, researchers, engineers, and most importantly, by the skilled technological workforce. This workforce played a critical support role in transforming inventions into high-volume, marketable products. We are currently at the heart of the Second Quantum Revolution, which is fueled by the research in quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. The scientific progress that is currently taking place in these areas is going to fundamentally change the way we sense the world around us, approach our security, and process critical information. Governments and private entities across the world have recognized the strategic importance of quantum research-enabled technologies and have invested a significant amount of money to support graduate programs and research institutions where scientists, engineers, and other professionals are earning advanced degrees and immediately being engaged in active Quantum 2.0 research. To the best of our knowledge, and despite considerable investment in quantum research, no active efforts or programs exist that would train a quantum technological workforce at the technician level to support Quantum 2.0. The quantum industry, on the other side, has clearly identified the need for highly skilled quantum technicians that are able to support the commercialization of the new products and inventions. The lack of a trained quantum technician workforce is a major shortcoming that may have a profound negative impact on the long-term prospects and sustainability of the emerging quantum industry. The EdQuantum project, funded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, is an effort to close this shortcoming and propose a well-defined curriculum through which the incumbent photonic and laser technicians in the United States will be upskilled with the new skills and competencies from quantum research-enabled technologies. This paper presents the results of the first phase of the EdQuantum project-the quantum industry survey. Over the last few months, we sought input from the quantum industry as to what skills and competencies should a future quantum technician possess to support its emerging needs. The results collected during the survey are presented in this paper along with their impact on the proposed educational curriculum. This paper also elaborates on the alignment of the proposed curriculum with a few ongoing initiatives in the skilled technical workforce education (such as NSB Vision 2030, Convergence Accelerators Initiative, and Skilled Technical Workforce Initiative).

(2020),2020,Multiscale Structural Characterization of Biobased Diallyl-Eugenol Polymer Networks,MACROMOLECULES,"Biosourced eugenol-based polymer networks have a potential functionality for antibacterial coating applications. The presence of carvacrol, a phenol compound, improves these properties. However, the relationship between the network structure and the macroscopic thermomechanical behavior is not known for these biopolymers. Thus, this work details a robust study of this relationship through a multiscale experimental approach combining Dielectric Spectroscopy, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis, tensile testing, and Time Domain Double-Quantum proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (DQ H-1 NMR). It was shown that carvacrol has an influence on the molecular mobility of the materials. Namely, it induces the appearance of a shouldering on the. relaxation and a diminishing of the main molecular alpha relaxation, T-a. More surprisingly, up to 20% wt, carvacrol increases the elastic E' and Young's E moduli. This observation can be interpreted as an increase of the crosslink density of the networks. Time Domain DQ H-1 NMR shows that the residual dipolar coupling constant also increases. Thus, carvacrol seems to act as both a thermal plasticizer and mechanical reinforcement, which may seem to be antagonistic trends. For carvacrol contents over 20% wt, these properties diminish because of a saturation of this molecule in the networks and the onset of a phase separation. By combining the aforementioned techniques, it was proven that carvacrol linearly increased the measured crosslink density and thermomechanical properties by physically bonding to the networks through pi-pi interactions. These interactions would act as physical crosslinks. This work demonstrates that by correlating the results of various multiscale experimental techniques, a better comprehension of the structure-property relationship can be established for biobased functional polymer networks.",,10.1021/acs.macromol.9b02280,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b02280,Journal

Termed Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, these prototypes are too small for large benchmarks or even for Quantum Error Correction (QEC), but they do have sufficient resources to run small benchmarks, particularly if compiled with optimizations to make use of scarce qubits and limited operation counts and coherence times. QC has not yet, however, settled on a particular preferred device implementation technology, and indeed different NISQ prototypes implement qubits with very different physical approaches and therefore widely-varying device and machine characteristics. Our work performs a full-stack, benchmark-driven hardware-software analysis of QC systems. We evaluate QC architectural possibilities, software-visible gates, and software optimizations to tackle fundamental design questions about gate set choices, communication topology, the factors affecting benchmark performance and compiler optimizations. In order to answer key cross-technology and cross-platform design questions, our work has built the first top-to-bottom toolflow to target different qubit device technologies, including superconducting and trapped ion qubits which are the current QC front-runners. We use our toolflow, TriQ, to conduct real-system measurements on seven running QC prototypes from three different groups, IBM, Rigetti, and University of Maryland. Overall, we demonstrate that leveraging microarchitecture details in the compiler improves program success rate up to 28x on IBM (geomean 3x), 2.3x on Rigetti (geomean 1.45x), and 1.47x on UMDTI (geomean 1.17x), compared to vendor toolflows. In addition, from these real-system experiences at QC's hardware-software interface, we make observations and recommendations about native and software-visible gates for different QC technologies, as well as communication topologies, and the value of noise-aware compilation even on lower-noise platforms.

The experimental exploration of endofullerene arrays comes at a time when machine learning techniques are rapidly being adopted to characterize, verify, and reconstruct quantum states from measurement data. In this paper, we develop a strategy for reconstructing the ground state of chains of dipolar rotors using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) adapted to train on data from higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate accurate generation of energy expectation values from an RBM trained on data in the free-rotor eigenstate basis and explore the learning resources required for various chain lengths and dipolar interaction strengths. Finally, we show evidence for fundamental limitations in the accuracy achievable by RBMs due to the difficulty in imposing symmetries in the sampling procedure. We discuss possible avenues to overcome this limitation in the future, including the further development of autoregressive models such as recurrent neural networks for the purposes of quantum state reconstruction.",,10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035108,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035108,Journal

In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a novel methodology for fault prognosis of hydraulic pump based on the bispectrum entropy and the deep belief network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the bispectrum features of vibration signals are analyzed, and a bispectrum entropy method based on energy distribution is proposed to extract the effective feature for prognostics. Then, the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model based on the Restrict Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is proposed as the prognostics model. For the purpose of accurately predicting the trends and the random fluctuations during the performance degradation of the hydraulic pump, the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) is introduced to search for the optimal value of initial parameters of the network.

With the advent of quantum computers, all encrypted communications based on traditional asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC) will become insecure. The definition the PQC standards is an on going process proceeding at a fast pace, involving new and largely unexplored cryptographic primitives. For this reason, the design of hardware implementations of PQC algorithms is still under study. In this paper, we introduce the fundamentals of PQC, with a focus on lattice-based cryptography and its hardware security issues, namely side-channel and fault-based attacks. Then, we focus on isogeny-based cryptography and the SIKE algorithm. We highlight the importance of fault-tolerant design choices through the presentation of a fault attack, based on the electromagnetic injection of transient faults, targeting this cryptographic primitive.

2253,WOS,Zhang & Zhang (2019),2019,Distillation of single-mode-squeezed entangled state in presence of strong squeezing,OSA CONTINUUM,"Recently, the strong single-mode squeezed vacuum state of light with 15 dB of classic noise has been created [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 110801 (2016)]. This is an important resource in continuous variable (CV) quantum communication and fault-tolerant quantum computing. Nevertheless, strong squeezing means a non-negligible population in high-photonnumber subspace and may pose a strong challenge to photon-based technology, for example, entanglement distillation. Entanglement distillation is an efficient method for retrieving a higher quality of entanglement from a weakly entangled state. Up till now, almost all the schemes for entanglement distillation are restricted to the low-squeezing regime. The distillation of strong-squeezing induced entanglement is an interesting but open topic in the near future. Here, we take the single-mode squeezed entangled state (SMSE) as an example and show that conventional photon subtraction based distillation fails to generate a higher quality of entanglement with experimentally feasible optical beam splitters. To this point, we show that the superposition of photon annihilation and creation could be an effective method. A practical scheme for implementing such a superposition with on-line squeezing is suggested. Our method is verified numerically by the calculation of a 25 dB SMSE state with an ideal photon detector and for distillation of 20.5 dB SMSE state with practical dichotic on-off detectors. The analysis of the distillation of the strong squeezing effect could be extended straightforwardly to other squeezing-based quantum information processing, such as quantum metrology and quantum illumination.

(2022),2022,The fabrication of atomically thin-MoS2 based photoanodes for photoelectrochemical energy conversion and environment remediation: A review,GREEN ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology has been proved a promising approach to solve the problems of energy shortages and environmental pollution damages. It can convert unlimited solar energy resources into energy forms needed by mankind. The development of highly efficient photoanodes is a key step in realizing the large-scale practical application of PEC systems. However, the development of PEC photoanodes has been severely hindered by the issues of easy recombination of photo-generated charge carriers, low photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, poor photo-corrosion resistance, and low catalytic activity. Therefore, constructing high-performance and stable photoanodes is an urgent research field to promote the progress of PEC technology. The atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (AT-MoS2) with unique physical and chemical properties has been widely applied in the fabrication of PEC photoanodes. The AT-MoS2 based photoanodes have exhibited excellent PEC performance, which providing promising candidates for ideal PEC application. Here, we summarize the fundamental natures of MoS2 and present the research efforts in the preparation of AT-MoS2 based photoanodes. Strategies for the fabrication of high-efficient AT-MoS2 based photoanodes are emphasized to provide guidelines to advance emerging PEC photoanodes. Besides, perspectives for the development of more efficient AT-MoS2 based photoanodes are proposed. (c) 2021 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

2255,WOS,D'Ariano (2019),2019,Information-theoretic derivation of free quantum field theory(*),FOUNDATIONS OF QUANTUM THEORY,"Recently the new information-theoretic paradigm of physics advocated by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman has concretely shown its full power, with the derivation of quantum theory and of free quantum field theory from informational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the possibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical theory, allowing a re-foundation of the whole physics over logically solid grounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new information-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly interesting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with the idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information processing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the holographic principle. In this lecture notes I review how free quantum field theory is derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special relativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is provided by the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum systems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple principles: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature of the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory in terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic argument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the currently observed regime where discreteness is not visible is the so-called relativistic regime of small wave vectors, which holds for all energies ever tested (and even much larger), where the usual free quantum field theory is perfectly recovered. In the present quantum discrete theory Einstein relativity principle can be restated without using space-time in terms of invariance of the eigenvalue equation of the automaton/walk under change of representations. Distortions of the Poincar ' e group emerge at the Planck scale, whereas special relativity is perfectly recovered in the relativistic regime. Discreteness, on the other hand, has some plus compared to the continuum theory: 1) it contains it as a special regime; 2) it leads to some additional features with GR flavor: the existence of an upper bound for the particle mass (with physical interpretation as the Planck mass), and a global De Sitter invariance; 3) it provides its own physical standards for space, time, and mass within a purely mathematical adimensional context. The lecture ends with future perspectives.",,10.3254/978-1-61499-937-9-203,http://dx.doi.org/10.3254/978-1-61499-937-9-203,Conference Paper
2256,WOS,Goel & Bajpai (2020),2020,Impact of Uncertainty in the Input Variables and Model Parameters on Predictions of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Based Sales Forecasting Model,MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION,"A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based sales model has been developed to forecast the global sales of hotel business of Travel Boutique Online Holidays (TBO Holidays). The LSTM model is a multivariate model; input to the model includes several independent variables in addition to a dependent variable, viz., sales from the previous step. One of the input variables, number of active bookers per day, is estimated for the same day as sales. This need for estimation requires the development of another LSTM model to predict the number of active bookers per day. The number of active bookers is variable, so the predicted is used as an input to the sales forecasting model. The use of a predicted variable as an input variable to another model increases the chance of uncertainty entering the system. This paper discusses the quantum of variability observed in sales predictions for various uncertainties or noise due to the estimation of the number of active bookers. For the purposes of this study, different noise distributions such as normalized, uniform, and logistic distributions are used, among others. Analyses of predictions demonstrate that the addition of uncertainty to the number of active bookers via dropouts as well as to the lagged sales variables leads to model predictions that are close to the observations. The least squared error between observations and predictions is higher for uncertainties modeled using other distributions (without dropouts) with the worst predictions being for Gumbel noise distribution. Gaussian noise added directly to the weights matrix yields the best results (minimum prediction errors). One possibility of this uncertainty could be that the global minimum of the least squared objective function with respect to the model weight matrix is not reached, and therefore, model parameters are not optimal. The two LSTM models used in series are also used to study the impact of corona virus on global sales. By introducing a new variable called the corona virus impact variable, the LSTM models can predict corona-affected sales within five percent (5%) of the actuals. The research discussed in the paper finds LSTM models to be effective tools that can be used in the travel industry as they are able to successfully model the trends in sales. These tools can be reliably used to simulate various hypothetical scenarios also.",,10.3390/make2030014,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/make2030014,Journal

(2020),2020,Compact and high-performance vortex mode sorter for multi-dimensional multiplexed fiber communication systems,OPTICA,"With the amplitude, time, wavelength/frequency, phase, and polarization/spin parameter dimensions of the light wave/photon almost fully utilized in both classical and quantum photonic information systems, orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by optical vortex modes is regarded as a new modal parameter dimension for further boosting the capacity and performance of the systems. To exploit the OAM mode space for such systems, stringent performance requirements on a pair of OAM mode multiplexer and demultiplexer (also known as mode sorters) must be met. In this work, we implement a newly discovered optical spiral transformation to achieve a low-cross-talk, wide-optical-bandwidth, polarization-insensitive, compact, and robust OAM mode sorter that realizes the desired bidirectional conversion between seven co-axial OAM modes carried by a ring-core fiber and seven linearly displaced Gaussian-like modes in parallel single-mode fiber channels. We further apply the device to successfully demonstrate high-spectral-efficiency and high-capacity data transmission in a 50-km OAM fiber communication link for the first time, in which a multi-dimensional multiplexing scheme multiplexes eight orbital-spin vortex mode channels with each mode channel simultaneously carrying 10 wavelength-division multiplexing channels, demonstrating the promising potential of both the OAM mode sorter and the multi-dimensional multiplexed OAM fiber systems enabled by the device. Our results pave the way for future OAM-based multi-dimensional communication systems.

We report on an optical super-resolution imaging scheme implementing joint tagging using multiple fluorescent blinking dyes associated with super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (JT-SOFI), achieving ultra-high labeling density super-resolution imaging. To demonstrate the feasibility of JT-SOFI, quantum dots with different emission spectra were jointly labeled to the tubulin in COS7 cells, creating ultra-high density labeling. After analyzing and combining the fluorescence intermittency images emanating from spectrally resolved quantum dots, the microtubule networks are capable of being investigated with high fidelity and remarkably enhanced contrast at sub-diffraction resolution. The spectral separation also significantly decreased the frame number required for SOFI, enabling fast super-resolution microscopy through simultaneous data acquisition. As the joint-tagging scheme can decrease the labeling density in each spectral channel, thereby bring it closer to single-molecule state, we can faithfully reconstruct the continuous microtubule structure with high resolution through collection of only 100 frames per channel. The improved continuity of the microtubule structure is quantitatively validated with image skeletonization, thus demonstrating the advantage of JT-SOFI over other localization-based super-resolution methods.",,10.1038/srep08359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep08359,Journal

By selecting different time positions, changing the power, and changing the frequency detuning of the laser field, the competition between the composite signals is demonstrated. It is found that as the laser parameters change, the signal evolves from a nonlinear.(4) process resulting in a FL signal to a SPFWM signal (.(3) process). In addition, the competition effect between the signals determines the evolution of the shape of the correlation from a pure sharp to a two-stage (mixed) shape and finally to a pure broad peak amplitude. Furthermore, the signal evolution determines the magnitude of squeezing, which can control the noise level. Such progress may find potential applications in optical hybrid communication and information processing.",,10.1103/PhysRevA.94.023849,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.023849,Journal

The nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are used as multifunctional probes to investigate various optical and electrical properties of nanostructures.

Concomitant friction coefficients can be calculated with either the local density friction approximation (LDFA) or orbital-dependent friction (ODF), which, unlike LDFA, accounts for anisotropy while relying on other approximations. Due to the computational cost of ODF, extensive high-dimensional MDEF trajectory calculations of experimentally measurable observables have hitherto only been performed based on LDFA. We overcome this limitation with a continuous neural-network-based representation. In our first application to the scattering of vibrationally excited H-2 and D-2 from Cu(111), we predict up to three times higher vibrational de excitation probabilities with ODF than with LDFA. These results indicate that anisotropic electronic friction can be important for specific molecular observables.

The vibrational excitation of HCl enhances the reactivity substantially, and the dissociation is most favored for HCl molecules colliding with rotation in a plane parallel to the Ag(111) surface (helicopter alignment). The influence of rotational excitation on the dissociation probability is much more complicated, with different trends at high and at low kinetic energies. The usage of three different PESs does not change the effects of vibrational excitation, rotational excitation, and rotational-alignment qualitatively, but it does change the magnitude of dissociation probabilities quantitatively due to the different barrier heights.

In semiconductor nanostructures, spin degrees of freedom can be used as auxiliary, powerful tools to modify the coherent optical dynamics. Here, we apply this approach to negatively charged (In,Ga)As/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots which are considered as excellent quantum emitters with robust optical coherence and high bandwidth. We study three-pulse spin-dependent photon echoes subject to moderate transverse magnetic fields up to 1 T. We demonstrate that the timescale of coherent optical response can be extended by at least an order of magnitude by the field. Without magnetic field, the photon echo decays with T-2 = 0.45 ns which is determined by the radiative lifetime of trions T-1 = 0.26 ns. In the presence of the transverse magnetic field, the decay of the photon echo signal is given by spin dephasing time of the ensemble of resident electrons T-2,T-e similar to 4 ns. We demonstrate that the non-zero transverse g-factor of the heavy holes in the trion state plays a crucial role in the temporal evolution and magnetic field dependence of the long-lived photon echo signal. Semiconductor nanostructures are central to the implementation of quantum communication and information technologies.

Providing the local oscillator power of the order of a few picowatts, we were practically able to reach the quantum noise limited sensitivity. The intermediate frequency gain bandwidth (also referred to as response or conversion bandwidth) was limited by the spectral band of a single-photon response pulse of the detector, which is proportional to the detector size. We observed a gain bandwidth of 65 MHz and 140 MHz for 7 x 7 mu m(2) and 3 x 3 mu m(2) devices, respectively. A tiny amount of the required local oscillator power and wide gain and noise bandwidths, along with unnecessary low noise amplification, make this technology prominent for various applications, with the possibility for future development of a photon counting heterodyne-born large-scale array.

Achieving giant nonlinearities under low light intensity is essential for weak-light nonlinear optics. In the past decades, such weak-light nonlinear phenomena have been demonstrated in photorefractive and photochromic materials.

Current advances in nonlinear metasurfaces are introduced, with a special emphasis on all-optical light controls. The tuning of the nonlinearity values using metasurfaces, including enhancement and sign reversal is presented.

We used the significant improvement in the accuracy of protein structure prediction recently implemented in AlphaFold that incorporates novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints of protein structures. The wild-type (WT) sequence and the mutated sequence, missing the Phe233, were reconstructed. The predicted local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) for the PURAwt and the PURA-Phe233del showed that the occurrence of the Phe233del affects between 220-320 amino acids. The distortion in the PURA structural conformation in the similar to 5 angstrom surrounding area after the p.Phe233del produces a conspicuous disruption of the repeat III, where the DNA and RNA helix unwinding capability occurs. PURA Protein-DNA docking corroborated these results in an in silico analysis that showed a loss of the contact of the PURA-Phe233del III repeat domain model with the DNA.

(2019),2019,Stationary entangled radiation from micromechanical motion,NATURE,"Mechanical systems facilitate the development of a hybrid quantum technology comprising electrical, optical, atomic and acoustic degrees of freedom(1), and entanglement is essential to realize quantum-enabled devices. Continuous-variable entangled fields-known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states-are spatially separated two-mode squeezed states that can be used for quantum teleportation and quantum communication(2). In the optical domain, EPR states are typically generated using nondegenerate optical amplifiers(3), and at microwave frequencies Josephson circuits can serve as a nonlinear medium(4-6). An outstanding goal is to deterministically generate and distribute entangled states with a mechanical oscillator, which requires a carefully arranged balance between excitation, cooling and dissipation in an ultralow noise environment. Here we observe stationary emission of path-entangled microwave radiation from a parametrically driven 30-micrometre-long silicon nanostring oscillator, squeezing the joint field operators of two thermal modes by 3.40 decibels below the vacuum level. The motion of this micromechanical system correlates up to 50 photons per second per hertz, giving rise to a quantum discord that is robust with respect to microwave noise(7). Such generalized quantum correlations of separable states are important for quantum-enhanced detection(8) and provide direct evidence of the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator without directly measuring its state(9). This noninvasive measurement scheme allows to infer information about otherwise inaccessible objects, with potential implications for sensing, open-system dynamics and fundamental tests of quantum gravity.

Integral to such capabilities is that military forces fundamentally depend on the rapid exchange of information in order for their decision-making processes to gain superiority on the battlefield: this compounds the need to develop network-enabled capabilities to realize network-centric warfare. This triangle of cyber offense, cyber defence, and cyber dependence creates a challenging and complex system of interdependencies. Alongside, while numerous technologies have not improved cyber security significantly, this may change with upcoming new concepts and systems, like decentralized ledger technologies (Blockchains) or quantum-secured communication. Following these thoughts, the paper analyses the development of both cyber threats and defence capabilities during the past 10 years, evaluates the current situation and gives recommendations for improvements. To this end, the paper is structured as follows: first, general conditions for military forces with respect to cyber are described, including an analysis of the most likely courses of action of the West and their seemingly traditional adversary in the East, Russia. The overview includes a discussion of the usefulness of the measures and an overview of upcoming technologies critical for cyber security. Finally. requirements and recommendations for the further development of cyber defence are briefly covered.",,,,Conference Paper

(2018),2018,Tuning Electroluminescence from a Plasmonic Cavity-Coupled Silicon Light Source,NANO LETTERS,"The combination of Moore's law and Dennard's scaling rules have constituted the fundamental guidelines for the silicon-based semiconductor industry for decades. Furthermore, the enormous growth of global data volume has pushed the demand for complex and densely packed devices. In recent years, it has become clear that wired interconnects impose increasingly severe speed and power limitations onto integrated circuits as scaling slows toward a halt. To overcome these limitations, there is a clear need for optical data processing. Despite significant progress in the development of silicon photonics, light sources remain challenging owing to the indirect bandgap of group IV materials. It is therefore highly desirable to develop new concepts for a silicon light source that meets efficiency and footprint requirements similar to their electronic counterparts. Here, we demonstrate an electrically driven and tunable silicon light source by matching the resonant modes of a silver nanocavity with the hot luminescence spectrum of an avalanching p-n junction. The cavity significantly enhances phonon-assisted recombination of hot carriers by tailoring the local density of states at the size-tunable resonance. Such tunable nanoscale emitter may be of great interest for short-reach communications, microdisplays or lab-on-chip applications.",,10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b03391,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b03391,Journal

This article provides a comprehensive review of the synthesis and applications of CBPOs. The design and synthetic strategies of a series of CBPOs (dimers, trimers, tetramers and others) are first introduced. Many CBPOs with multi-cavities and unique geometry are very attractive and efficient building blocks for constructing novel smart supramolecular polymers (SPs) with different topological structures through host-guest interactions. We describe the methods of constructing various SPs based on CBPOs in detail. Furthermore, the extensive applications of CBPOs and CBPO-based SPs in recognition and detection of ions and organic small molecules, selective adsorption and separation, artificial light-harvesting systems, catalysis, drug delivery systems, and others are systematically introduced.

2277,WOS,Sudhagar et al. (2016),2016,Exploring Graphene Quantum Dots/TiO2 interface in photoelectrochemical reactions: Solar to fuel conversion,ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA,"Photocarrier (e(-)/ h(+)) generation at low dimension graphene quantum dots offers multifunctional applications including bioimaging, optoelectronics and energy conversion devices. In this context, graphene quantum dots onto metal oxide electron transport layer finds great deal of attention in solar light driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen fuel generation. The merits of combining tailored optical properties of the graphene quantum dots sensitizer with the transport properties of the host wide band gap one dimensional nanostructured semiconductor provide a platform for high charge collection which promotes catalytic proton reduction into fuel generation at PEC cells. However, understanding the underlying mechanism of photocarrier transfer characteristics at graphene quantum dots/metal oxide interface during operation is often difficult as graphene quantum dots may have a dual role as sensitizer and catalyst. Therefore, exploring photocarrier generation and injection at graphene quantum dot/metal oxide heterointerfaces in contact with hole scavenging electrolyte afford a new pathway in developing graphene quantum dots based photoelectrochemical fuel generation systems. In this work, we demonstrate direct assembly of surface modified graphene quantum dots (similar to 2 nm particle size) onto TiO2 hollow nanowire (similar to 3 mm in length and similar to 100 to 250 nm in diameter) by electrostatic attraction and examine the photocarrier accumulation and recombination processes leading to device operation. Optical characterization reveals that GQDs absorbed light photons at visible light wavelength up to 600 nm. Hybrid TiO2-GQDs heterostructures show a photocurrent enhancement of similar to 70% for water oxidation compared to pristine TiO2 using sacrificial-free electrolyte, which is further validated by incident photon to current efficiency. Additionally, the charge accumulation processes and charge transfer characteristics are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These results provide the platform to understand the insights of graphene quantum dots/metal oxide interfaces in PEC reactions and discuss the feasibility of graphene quantum dots in wide range of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical based fuel conversion devices.

In our opinion, optomechanical methods can accurately monitor and control the mechanical properties of isolated MTs in a liquid environment.

The BIC-based OV generators have the potential to outperform their counterparts that rely on spatial variations in terms of design feasibility, fabrication complexity, and robustness. However, given the fact that this class of OV generators originates from the topological property of the photonic bands, their responses are generally fixed and cannot be dynamically altered, which limits their applications to photonic systems. Here, we numerically demonstrate that a silicon photonic crystal slab can be used to realize optically switchable OV generation by simultaneously exploiting the vortex topology in momentum space in conjunction with silicon's nonlinear dynamics. Picosecond switching of OV beams at near-infrared wavelengths are observed. The demonstrated nontrivial topological nature of the active generators can significantly expand the application of BIC toward ultrafast vortex beam generation, high-capacity optical communication, and mode-division multiplexing.",,10.1088/1367-2630/ac52c0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ac52c0,Journal

(2017),2017,Materials Science Literature-Patent Relevance Search: A Heterogeneous Network Analysis Approach,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS (DSAA),"In recent decades, materials science literature and patents have grown exponentially. This has also contributed to an ever-growing challenge whether the literature is current, as there can be a gap between when the patent was filed and when it was approved. Moreover, it is difficult to ensure that a patent cites the appropriate prior art due to variety and volume of materials science data, especially when it is in two separate sources that have different curation mechanisms and purpose - publications and patents. The existing relational database schema, generally used to store publications, also presents challenges given the strict tabular schema, which may not be appropriate for organizing and querying highly interconnected information about materials in these publications and patents. For example, elements are chemically combined to form a compound, which can then be converted to other compounds via chemical reactions. Furthermore, relational database is not designed for handling combining data from multiple sources and with various formats, thus it makes discover relevance between publications and patents become difficult. In order to explore an alternative approach to represent materials data and combine data from multiple sources into the same repository, in this work, we propose a solution to integrate data from Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and patent data from USPTO1 database into a network and named it heterogeneous materials information network (HMIN). We generalize prior work which based on using meta path-based topological features to explore the network, and we propose features to identify network noise and investigate relatedness between different-typed objects to meet our application needs. We built several machine learning models by using these features to explore relevance between materials science publications and patents. Experiment results show that HMIN can help researchers effectively discover related publications and patents originally kept in different sources.

The modelling formalisms for the two regimes are often very different due to the high temperature (room temperature) regime of the former and the low temperature (milli-Kelvin) regime of the latter. In this talk we unite the two approaches into a simpler formalism and investigate the similarities. Model expressions for the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in a quantum dot are obtained. The resulting form does not neglect cubic terms and allows for a generalized structural inversion asymmetry. We also obtain analytical expressions for the coupling between states for the electron-phonon interaction and use these to derive spinrelaxation rates, which are found to be qualitatively similar to those derived elsewhere in the literature. We find that, due to the inclusion of cubic terms, the Dresselhaus contribution to the ground state spin relaxation disappears for spherical dots. A comparison with previous theory and existing experimental results shows good agreement thereby presenting a clear analytical formalism for future developments.

Besides that, nanoscale optical wireless channels including visible light spectrum are alternatives to radio-frequency communications promising energy efficiency and high data rates. In this article, vibrating multi-layer graphene nanoelectromechanical resonators are combined with designed vibrating Forster resonance energy transfer (VFRET) mechanism to achieve a nanoscale acousto-optic modulator converting vibrations to multi-color photon emissions. The frequency, color and the vibration sensitivity of emission are tunable while vibrations are realized either passively or actively by exploiting acoustic, thermo-acoustic or opto-acoustic properties of graphene. The light is generated by FRET mechanism with oscillating donor-acceptor distance where donor molecules attached on graphene are chosen as CdSe/ZnS core-shell QDs with significant properties of broad absorption spectrum, large cross-sections, tunable emission spectra, size dependent emission wavelength, high photochemical stability and improved quantum yield. The designed modulator achieves acoustic and ultrasound frequencies between several KHz and tens of MHz and radiation power reaching several nanowatts with resonator sizes of hundreds of micrometers for ambient light intensity of 0.1 W/m(2)/nm.

However, with rapidly developing technology, the available encryption techniques are becoming more prone to attack every day. Focusing this issue, in this paper, we propose a new technique of encryption that will enhance the security level by a significant margin with the help of quantum computing. Additionally, our proposed technique also enhances data transmission rate through exploiting the notion of Superdense Coding. Such simultaneous improvement in both security level and data transmission rate, which we achieve through our proposed technique, is a rare trait for currently available encryption technique. We name our proposed technique SuperCrypt. We elaborate implementation issues pertinent for SuperCrypt such as recycling qubits and re-establishing entanglement. We also implement SuperCrypt in a discrete-event network simulator ns-2 and evaluate the performance of SuperCrypt through analyzing the simulation results. The simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvement through SuperCrypt compared to available classical alternative.

A research contribution focusing on the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)-enabled solutions assisting in the security framework of an optical 5G fronthaul segment is presented. We thoroughly investigate the integration of a BB84-QKD link, operating at telecom band, delivering quantum keys for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption engines of a packetized fronthaul layer interconnecting multiple 5G terminal nodes. Secure Key Rate calculations are studied for both dedicated and shared fiber configurations to identify the attack surface of AES-encrypted data links in each deployment scenario. We also propose a converged fiber-wireless scenario, exploiting a mesh networking extension operated by mmWave wireless links. In addition to the quantum layer performance, emphasis is placed on the strict requirements of 5G-oriented optical edge segments, such as the latency and the availability of quantum keys. We find that for the dark fiber case, secret keys can be distilled at fiber lengths much longer than the maximum fiber fronthaul distance corresponding to the round-trip latency barrier, for both P2P and P2MP topologies. On the contrary, the inelastic Raman scattering makes the simultaneous transmission of quantum and classical signals much more challenging. To counteract the contamination of noise photons, a resilient classical/QKD coexistence scheme is adopted. Motivated by the recent advancements in quantum technology roadmap, our analysis aims to introduce the QKD blocks as a pillar of the quantum-safe security framework of the 5G/B5G-oriented fronthaul infrastructure.",,10.3390/app10155193,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10155193,Journal

Automated symbolic evaluation of SU(2) algebra,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A,"The ongoing progress in (nuclear) many-body theory is accompanied by an ever-rising increase in complexity of the underlying formalisms used to solve the stationary Schrodinger equation. The associated working equations at play in state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear many-body methods can be analytically reduced with respect to angular-momentum, i.e. SU(2), quantum numbers whenever they are effectively employed in a symmetry-restricted context. The corresponding procedure constitutes a tedious and error-prone but yet an integral part of the implementation of those many-body frameworks. Indeed, this symmetry reduction is a key step to advance modern simulations to higher accuracy since the use of symmetry-adapted tensors can decrease the computational complexity by orders of magnitude. While attempts have been made in the past to automate the (anti-) commutation rules linked to Fermionic and Bosonic algebras at play in the derivation of the working equations, there is no systematic account to achieve the same goal for their symmetry reduction. In this work, the first version of an automated tool performing graph-theory-based angular-momentum reduction is presented. Taking the symmetry-unrestricted expressions of a generic tensor network as an input, the code provides their angular-momentum-reduced form in an error-safe way in a matter of seconds.

Here, we demonstrate high-surface-area mesoporous networks comprising interconnected beta-Ni(OH)(2) modified CdS nanocrystals (NCs) as highly active and stable photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. Compared to single-component CdS assemblies, Ni-modified materials present a strong enhancement of photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). By controlling the formation of beta-Ni(OH)(2) species, the mesoporous beta-Ni(OH)(2)/CdS heterojunction networks at a 10 wt % Ni content reached an outstanding photocatalytic H-2-evolution rate of 1.4 mmol h(-1) at 20 degrees C (or 35 mmol g(-1) h(-1) mass activity), associated with an apparent quantum yield (QY) of 72% at 420 nm in a 5 M NaOH aqueous solution containing 10% v/v ethanol as sacrificial reagent. Mechanistic study with UV vis/nearinfrared, photoluminescence, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocatalytic performance evaluation reveals that the improved photocatalytic performance arises from the strong electronic coupling and charge-transferred states at the p-n beta-Ni(OH)(2)/CdS heterojunctions.

In this paper, we expand the class of LC decomposable system with some generalizations. In addition, we propose two general sufficient conditions for LC decomposability with a procedure to systematically realize the LC decomposition. Some examples of LC decomposable linear dynamical systems are also presented with their graphs. The generalization of the LC decomposition is implemented in the following three aspects: (i) the type of linear operators; (ii) the shape of dendritic networks on which linear operators are defined; and (iii) the type of symmetry operations representing the symmetry of the systems. In the generalization (iii), symmetry groups that represent the symmetry of dendritic systems are defined. The LC decomposition is realized by changing the basis of a linear operator defined on a dendritic network into bases of irreducible representations of the symmetry group. The achievement of this paper makes it easier to utilize the LC decomposition in various cases. This may lead to a further understanding of the relation between structure and functions of dendrimers in future studies.

2292,WOS,Damgard et al. (2015),2015,On the Orthogonal Vector Problem and the Feasibility of Unconditionally Secure Leakage-Resilient Computation,INFORMATION THEORETIC SECURITY (ICITS 2015),"We consider unconditionally secure leakage resilient two-party computation. Security means that the leakage obtained by an adversary can be simulated using a similar amount of leakage from the private inputs or outputs. A related problem is known as circuit compilation, where there is only one device doing a computation on public input and output. Here the goal is to ensure that the adversary learns only the input/output behaviour of the computation, even given leakage from the internal state of the device. We study these problems in an enhanced version of the only computation leaks model, where the adversary is additionally allowed a bounded amount of global leakage from the state of the entity under attack. In this model, we show the first unconditionally secure leakage resilient two-party computation protocol. The protocol assumes access to correlated randomness in the form of a functionality f(ORT) that outputs pairs of orthogonal vectors (u, v) over some finite field, where the adversary can leak independently from u and from v. We also construct a general circuit compiler secure in the same leakage model. Our constructions work, even if the adversary is allowed to corrupt a constant fraction of the calls to f(ORT) and decide which vectors should be output. On the negative side, we show that unconditionally secure two-party computation and circuit compilation are in general impossible in the plain version of our model. It follows that even a somewhat unreliable version of f(ORT) cannot be implemented with unconditional security in the plain leakage model, using classical communication. However, we show that an implementation using quantum communication does exist. In particular, we propose a simple prepare-and-measure type protocol which we show secure using a new result on sampling from a quantum population. Although the protocol may produce a small number of incorrect pairs, this is sufficient for leakage resilient computation by our other results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantum protocol is used constructively for leakage resilience.

To achieve this goal an improved molecularly imprinted strategy relying on the embedding of a functional monomer containing an azobenzene chromophore as light-responsive element, on the crosslinked tridimensional molecular imprinted network, has been assessed. To address the mechanisms underlying template recognition and uptake/release of the analyte from the functional imprinted material, computational studies using a quantum chemical approach, have been explored. This new functional sorbent provides a straightforward controllable uptake/release of the target template using light as the stimuli tool, which is highly advantageous due to light manipulation characteristics, such as superior clean, precision and remote controllable properties. In general, this work will contribute to the implementation of a photoswitchable analytical methodology that proves to be suitable for the selective isolation and further quantification of dimethoate from olive oil matrices at levels similar to the maximum residues limits imposed by the legislation. The limits of detection, calculated based on 3 sigma, was 1.6 mgL(-1) and the limit of quantification, based on 10 sigma, was 5.2 mgL(-1). The implemented sample preparation shows high reproducibility and recoveries (93.3 +/- 0.4%). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

2296,WOS,Usami (2020),2020,New World Explored by 5G,2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (ICCE),"5G services have already been launched by more than 50 telecom operators in 28 countries in 2019. Four operators in Japan will also be ready for starting 5G commercial services in 1Q/2020. Superior wireless features or 5G; (1) eMBB: enhanced mobile broadband up to 20Gbit/s, (2) URLLC: ultra-reliable and low latency communications less than 1ms, and (3) mMTC: massive machine type communication over 1 million devices/km(2) , open a door to realize a new world, that we had never experienced before. Augment is a key word for 5G services. In this talk, some examples of 'Augment's will be given; how sports, city walks, and entertainments will be augmented and innovated by 5G technologies will be presented, and the audiences will be experienced such a new world by watching several demonstration videos. In addition to a new real experience for personal services, 5G is also strongly expected to solve variety of social issues, such as autonomous driving, remote control of construction machine, and remote surveillance with 4K/8K video. Low latency feature of 5G is essential for such critical missions. KDDI research inc. has been studying various advanced technologies, which supports the basis of the 5G services. In our optical access technology using the analog transmission technique, we have recently succeeded in a 1024QAM transmission for mobile fronthaul links for the first time. In our post-quantum cryptography technology, breaking several world records in cryptanalysis were reviewed. We have recently proposed the fastest algorithm for fully homomorphic encryption, which might be utilized for privacy-preserving machine learning as a service. Finally, tele-existence as a rather future oriented demonstration was presented, which is a robotic system that expands the presence of human beings. An experience of remote traveling to Ogasawara island 1500 miles away from Tokyo, where the traveler touched a sea turtle with a real sense of touch through an avatar robot, was demonstrated. A new world explored by 5G is widely forecasted. 5G is just in front of us. KDDI implements various initiatives and aims to provide an unlimited world in the coming 5G era.",,,,Conference Paper

We report on periodically poled ridge waveguides in z-cut potassium titanyl phosphate (KTiOPO4 or KTP), a material that has recently received growing interest due to its unique dispersion properties. Ridges were defined in surface-near rubidium-exchanged KTP by use of a precise diamond-blade dicing saw. We fabricated single-mode ridge waveguides at around 800 nm which exhibit widths of 1.9-3.2 mu m and facilitated type-11 second harmonic generation from 792 nm to 396 nm with high efficiency of 6.6 %/W.cm(2). Temperature dependence of the second harmonic process was found to be 53 pm/K. The low temperature dependence and high nonlinear conversion efficiency make our waveguides ideally suited for future operations in classical nonlinear integrated optics and integrated quantum networking applications.

2298,WOS,Shu et al. (2022),2022,Diabatic States of Molecules,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A,"Quantitative simulations of electronically nonadiabatic molecular processes require both accurate dynamics algorithms and accurate electronic structure information. Direct semiclassical nonadiabatic dynamics is expensive due to the high cost of electronic structure calculations, and hence it is limited to small systems, limited ensemble averaging, ultrafast processes, and/or electronic structure methods that are only semiquantitatively accurate. The cost of dynamics calculations can be made manageable if analytic fits are made to the electronic structure data, and such fits are most conveniently carried out in a diabatic representation because the surfaces are smooth and the couplings between states are smooth scalar functions. Diabatic representations, unlike the adiabatic ones produced by most electronic structure methods, are not unique, and finding suitable diabatic representations often involves time-consuming nonsystematic diabatization steps. The biggest drawback of using diabatic bases is that it can require large amounts of effort to perform a globally consistent diabatization, and one of our goals has been to develop methods to do this efficiently and automatically. In this Feature Article, we introduce the mathematical framework of diabatic representations, and we discuss diabatization methods, including adiabatic-to-diabatic transformations and recent progress toward the goal of automatization.",,10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10583,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10583,Journal
2299,WOS,D'Ariano (2017),2017,Physics Without Physics The Power of Information-theoretical Principles,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS,"David Finkelstein was very fond of the new information-theoretic paradigm of physics advocated by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman. Only recently, however, the paradigm has concretely shown its full power, with the derivation of quantum theory (Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. A 84:012311, 2011; D'Ariano et al., 2017) and of free quantum field theory (D'Ariano and Perinotti, Phys. Rev. A 90:062106, 2014; Bisio et al., Phys. Rev. A 88:032301, 2013; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 354:244, 2015; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 368:177, 2016) from informational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the possibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical theory, allowing a re-foundation of the whole physics over logically solid grounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new information-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly interesting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with the idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information processing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the holographic principle (Susskind, J. Math. Phys. 36:6377, 1995; Bousso, Rev. Mod. Phys. 74:825, 2002). In this paper I review how free quantum field theory is derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special relativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is simply provided by the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum systems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple principles: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature of the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory in terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic argument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the currently observed regime where discreteness is not visible is the so-called relativistic regime of small wavevectors, which holds for all energies ever tested (and even much larger), where the usual free quantum field theory is perfectly recovered. In the present quantum discrete theory Einstein relativity principle can be restated without using space-time in terms of invariance of the eigenvalue equation of the automaton/walk under change of representations. Distortions of the Poincar, group emerge at the Planck scale, whereas special relativity is perfectly recovered in the relativistic regime. Discreteness, on the other hand, has some plus compared to the continuum theory: 1) it contains it as a special regime; 2) it leads to some additional features with GR flavor: the existence of an upper bound for the particle mass (with physical interpretation as the Planck mass), and a global De Sitter invariance; 3) it provides its own physical standards for space, time, and mass within a purely mathematical adimensional context. The paper ends with the future perspectives of this project, and with an Appendix containing biographic notes about my friendship with David Finkelstein, to whom this paper is dedicated.",,10.1007/s10773-016-3172-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10773-016-3172-y,Journal

Millimeter-Wave systems have a high available bandwidth and the potential to accommodate numerous antennas in a small area, which makes them an attractive candidate for future networks employing spatial modulation and space-time shift keying (STSK). Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems are capable of achieving an increased throughput, by allowing multiple users to share the same resources at the cost of a higher transmission power, or an increased detection (preprocessing) complexity at the receiver (transmitter) of an uplink (downlink) scenario. In this paper, we propose the new concept of joint-alphabet space time shift keying. As an application scenario, we employ it in the context of the uplink of NOMA mm-Wave systems. We demonstrate with the aid of extrinsic information transfer charts that a higher capacity is achievable when compared with STSK, while retaining the attractive flexibility of STSK in terms of its diversity gain and coding rate. Finally, we conceive quantum-assisted detectors for reducing the detection complexity, while attaining a near-optimal performance, when compared with the optimal iterative maximum A posteriori probability detector.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2736978,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2736978,Journal

However, compared to extensive work on visible/infrared-light photodetection, polarization-sensitive perovskite photodetectors targeted at the ultraviolet (UV) region have not been reported. In addition, most of the previously reported photodetectors concentrated on lead-halide perovskites, but the lead-toxicity and poor stability severely restricted their practical applications. In this study, for the first time, one-dimensional CsCu2I3 nanowires (NWs) were used as the light absorber to fabricate a polarization-sensitive UV photodetector because of their electric and optical anisotropy of the asymmetric structure and external morphology anisotropy, and a high photocurrent anisotropy ratio of similar to 3.16 was achieved. Owing to the high crystallinity of the CsCu2I3 NWs, the device exhibits remarkable photodetection ability with a photoresponsivity of similar to 32.3 A W-1, a specific detectivity of 1.89 x 10(12) Jones, and a fast response speed of 6.94/214 mu s. Moreover, such a device fabricated on a flexible substrate shows almost no photodetection degradation after extreme bending for 1000 cycles, demonstrating good flexibility and bending endurance. The results obtained highlight the great potential of such copper halides as a stable and environmentally-friendly candidate for polarization-sensitive UV photodetectors, rendering them potentially useful for assembly of optoelectronic systems in the future.",,10.1039/d0mh00250j,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0mh00250j,Journal

Herein, we improve the enzymatic activity of a phosphotriesterase trimer (PTE3), an enzyme that selectively recognizes OPs directly, by conjugation with distinctly sized (i.e., 5, 10, and 20 nm diameter) gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The number of enzymes immobilized on the AuNP was controlled by conjugating increasing molar ratios of PTE3 onto the AuNP surface via metal affinity coordination. This occurs between the PTE3-His(6) termini and the AuNP-displayed Ni2+ -nitrilotriacetic acid end groups and was confirmed with gel electrophoresis. The enzymatic efficiency of the resultant PTE3-AuNP bioconjugates was analyzed via enzyme progress curves acquired from two distinct assay formats that compared free unbound PTE3 with the following PTE3-AuNP bioconjugates: (1) fixed concentration of AuNPs while increasing the bioconjugate molar ratio of PTE3 displayed around the AuNP and (2) fixed concentration of PTE3 while increasing the bioconjugate molar ratio of PTE3-AuNP by decreasing the AuNP concentration. Both assay formats monitored the absorbance of p-nitrophenol that was produced as PTE3 hydrolyzed the substrate paraoxon, a commercial insecticide and OP nerve agent simulant. Results demonstrate a general equivalent trend between the two formats. For all experiments, a maximum enzymatic velocity (V-max) increased by 17-fold over free enzyme for the lowest PTE3-AuNP ratio and the largest AuNP (i.e., ratio of 1 : 1, 20 nm dia. AuNP). This work provides a route to improve enzymatic OP detection strategies with enzyme-NP bioconjugates.",,10.1039/c6an02575g,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6an02575g,Journal

However, the state-of-the-art matrix materials for the FRET need to be improved in terms of universal loading for all types of luminescent moieties and the matrix integrability with real-life devices, but without sacrificing the FRET efficiency, i.e., maintaining the proximity of the embedded donors and acceptors. Amphiphilic polymer co-networks (APCNs) are investigated as versatile matrix materials for hosting luminescent materials and realizing highly efficient FRET between hydrophobic inorganic donors (CsPbBr3 nanocrystals) and hydrophilic organic acceptors (Rhodamine B). APCNs are advantageous owing to the unique properties of their hydrophilic and hydrophobic biphasic nature and the uniformly distributed nano-domains. The energy transfer rate can be tailored in a straightforward way by manipulating the nano-domain sizes and volumetric distribution, so steering donor-acceptor pair loading and distances. Consequently, APCNs are used as luminescent solar concentrators for fiber solar cells, demonstrating the ability to enhance existing solar-energy harvesting electronics via photonic energy transfer steering. APCN is demonstrated as a powerful matrix for future photonic applications in the field of energy harvesting and energy generation.",,10.1002/aenm.202200441,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202200441,Journal

Unlike polar gallium nitride-based optoelectronics, non-polar gallium nitride-based optoelectronics have gained huge attention due to the piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization effect-induced quantum confined-stark effect being eliminated. In turn, non-polar gallium nitride-based photodetectors portray higher efficiency and faster response compared to the polar growth direction. To date, however, a systematic literature review of non-polar gallium nitride-based photodetectors has yet to be demonstrated. Hence, the objective of this systematic literature review is to critically analyze the data related to non-polar gallium nitride-based photodetectors. Based on the pool of literature, three categories are introduced, namely, growth and fabrication, electrical properties, and structural, morphological, and optical properties. In addition, bibliometric analysis, a precise open-source tool, was used to conduct a comprehensive science mapping analysis of non-polar gallium nitride-based photodetectors. Finally, challenges, motivations, and future opportunities of non-polar gallium nitride-based photodetectors are presented.

With the growing popularity of the use of fiber optic communication systems, there is a need to protect transmission lines against unauthorized interference and data interception. Classical Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) allows to transfer quantum key and interrupt transmission when it detects interference. The use of proven as safe protocols BB84 in conjunction with currently used encryption techniques provide better data safety. However, due to lack of evidence on the safety of transmission using commercial QKD systems, their apply to the protection of classified information is currently impossible.

Since the advent of graphene, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely concerned by scientists. With excellent electronic and optical properties, 2D materials are widely used in optoelectronic devices. At present, the traditional photodetectors have many disadvantages and cannot be widely applied, so the photodetectors based on the 2D materials comes into being. In the family of 2D materials, there is a new group of typical materials that are transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbon nitrides, called MXenes. They have unique crystal structure, excellent electronic, optical and thermal properties, large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity and other excellent properties, which have attracted extensive research by scientists. And they have been used in catalysis, energy storage, sensors, capacitors, battery electrodes, biomedicine and photodetectors.

The short-wave infrared (SWIR, 900-1700 nm) spectral range is considered as a novel optical tissue window due to low photon scattering. In this work, we investigated the fluorescence characteristics of FCDs based on the SWIR spectral range. SWIR emissions were observed from FCDs for the first time, when long-wavelength excitation (e.g. longer than 731 nm) was adopted. Wavelength-tunable two-photon fluorescence could also be obtained from the FCDs, under 1000-1560 nm SWIR femtosecond (fs) excitation. Interestingly, when an fs excitation wavelength as long as 1560 nm was adopted, two typical nonlinear optical signals, namely two-photon fluorescence and third harmonic generation (THG), could be observed. Based on the one-photon SWIR fluorescence, FCDs were successfully utilized for in vivo sentinel node mapping and tumour imaging. Under SWIR fs excitation, FCD-assisted two-photon fluorescence microscopy realized deep-tissue imaging of zebrafish embryos and the brain neuron networks of mice.

However, with emission wavelength extended to MIR, multiphonon relaxation process that strongly quenched the MIR emission is one of the greatest challenges for such practical applications.

Detailed spectroscopic evolutions in the region of MIR, near-infrared (NIR), visible upconversion (UC) and their corresponding decay times provide insight investigation into the fluorescent mechanism caused by multiphonon relaxation. A possible energy transfer model has also been established. Our results present direct observation and mechanistic investigation of fluorescent evolution in multiphonon relaxation process, which is conductive to design MIR fluorescent materials in the future.

2313,WOS,Dresselhaus et al. (2021),2021,Numerical evidence for marginal scaling at the integer quantum Hall transition,ANNALS OF PHYSICS,"The integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) is one of the most mysterious members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling behavior near the IQHT has been vigorously studied in experiments and numerical simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin down the precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details and thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, Zirnbauer (2019) [1] has conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition, in which linear terms in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow in the fixed point's vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we provide numerical evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations of various network models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality, we show that the finite-size scaling of the disorder averaged longitudinal Landauer conductance is consistent with its recently predicted fixed-point value and a third-order expansion of RG beta functions. In the future, our numerical findings can be checked with analytical results from the conformal field theory. Away from criticality we describe a mechanism that could account for the emergence of an effective critical exponents nu eff, which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We further support this idea by numerical determination of nu eff in suitably chosen models. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

2314,WOS,Van de Bogart (2018),2018,Orchestrations of consciousness in the universe: Consciousness and electronic music applied to Xenolinguistics and Adnyamathanha aboriginal songs,TECHNOETIC ARTS,"This article deals with the reframing of the concept of universal mediated communication on a global scale. Subjects include the following: the universe has a conscious force field at all its scales, requiring continuous inter-scale communication of information; the field exhibits distinct electromagnetic frequencies associated with the building blocks of life; and advances in the technology of sound production with electronic synthesizers can be applied to study mechanisms of such universal communication. The question being addressed is how electronic synthesizers can be used to create sonic xenolinguistic expressions when composing with sonified frequencies obtained from bio-organisms, human protein structures, phonemes and various types of interstellar frequencies that include, but are not limited to, gamma bursts, pulsars and neutron stars. The objective is to construct sonic xenolingusitic expressions that can act like feedback loops within the field of consciousness. These sonic expressions can include anomalous cognitive, emotive or spiritual experiences that may be emerging out of the universal field of consciousness in real time. Xenolinguistics is a hypothetical language used to communicate with other sentient beings in the universe. The rationale for composing sonic xenolingustic expressions is the belief that the universe is considered conscious and that there is a field of consciousness existing throughout the universe that in principle is also instrumental in how communication can evolve with extraterrestrials. Outlines of other attempts at extraterrestrial communication by other researchers will be offered based on current literature. The probability that other life forms have established some mode of information exchange that is detectable and that, in return, may be able to create a form of communication to respond will be covered. It is postulated that various energy fields existing before and after the creation of our universe interacted with one another becoming abiotic, and then over time, formed even more complex structures. It is these complex structures that were then able to communicate essential information for maintaining their stability and survivability by using specific signalling frequencies. It is hypothesized that first life in the universe emerged within an already existing field of information and that our consciousness is thereby able to establish communication with other forms of consciousness in the universe. It is on this basis that a novel scientific and philosophical paradigm is considered in which the universe is conceived of as an active information matrix that can entertain potential extraterrestrial communication. In this framework, the present article will offer a new approach to orchestrated electronic sounds as a means to such communication. By integrating quantum physical properties into that sonic framework, a new study emerged on how sonic xenolinguistic elements can be incorporated into electronic composition techniques. This new framework may produce new algorithms for musical expression that not only represent an innovative future of electronic music but may also be crucial in the formulation and induction of new states of consciousness that will enable humankind to directly participate in the further becoming of the universe as a result of the evolution of this universal field of consciousness.",,10.1386/tear.16.1.113_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1386/tear.16.1.113_1,Journal
2315,WOS,Vakili (2018),2018,SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY,COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY,"Systems thinking is a holistic thinking which indicates that our planet is a self-organizing living system with inherit ability to sustain life, also, human being is interconnected and inseparable part of this living system. The main question is how human being which is the byproduct of an amazing creative process-from a single cell to current human-has seemingly lost this inherent ability and practices unsustainable activities? The answer could be in Linear thinking and self - consciousness process: In the early stages of human development human beings started to use their hands and vocal system to increase their ability to cooperate with each other. They used sign language for short-range communication and vocal projections for long-range communication. They mimicked the sounds that other animals made to attract harmless animals and distract dangerous ones. Combining sign language and vocal projections eventually created a subjective virtual world of information; an abstract concept, separated from real objects. The separation of subject from the object started us down the road to abstract thinking and the linear perception and thinking of self-consciousness. Thus, we have elusively experience ourselves as independent, separated from the living network. We therefore attempt to protect our separated self from the rest of the universe. Linear thinking ends up being self-defensive, self-protecting, self-assertive, dominating and sensitive to liability management violent events and negative news. When we analyze human body as a living system we notice that subconsciously our brain is in full synchrony and corporation with our body network in performing any simple action. But consciously through linear logic our brain illusively separate itself from body network and exercises self-assertive, and dominant relationship with the network to satisfy its short-term desires and entertainments-could be addiction to sugar, coffee, drug, information or other-. Then we apply the same attitude in our relationship with earth, other species, and even among human network. which results in a dominate and competitive attitude toward the other members of the web of life. The paradigm shift begins by recognizing that our brain is a living system capable of self-organizing according to the feedback loops provided by observing our thoughts and actions with the memes and values of the living system. Through this process our brain begins to acknowledge that the idea of a separated and independent self is only an illusion. It realizes that our self-existence, long term health and functionality require a sustainable relationship of cooperation and partnership with the body network and indeed with web of the life. Digital age is characterized by exponential rate of change, uncertainty and trending away from predictability and stability toward the emergence of a new system. The emerging paradigm shift requires a holistic approach intrinsic to spiritual tradition, as well as to nonlinear theories such as quantum mechanics, systems theory, networking theory, chaos theory and fractal geometry. It will unify science and spirituality, right and left brain, masculine and feminine, and provide universal memes and values applicable to any relationship or process at any scale.",,,,Journal

(2015),2015,Monolithic Silicon Photonics in a Sub-100nm SOI CMOS Microprocessor Foundry: Progress from Devices to Systems,SILICON PHOTONICS X,"We review recent progress of an effort led by the Stojanovic (UC Berkeley), Ram (MIT) and Popovic (CU Boulder) research groups to enable the design of photonic devices, and complete on-chip electro-optic systems and interfaces, directly in standard microelectronics CMOS processes in a microprocessor foundry, with no in-foundry process modifications. This approach allows tight and large-scale monolithic integration of silicon photonics with state-of-theart (sub-100nm-node) microelectronics, here a 45nm SOI CMOS process. It enables natural scale-up to manufacturing, and rapid advances in device design due to process repeatability. The initial driver application was addressing the processor-to-memory communication energy bottleneck. Device results include 5Gbps modulators based on an interleaved junction that take advantage of the high resolution of the sub-100nm CMOS process. We demonstrate operation at 5fJ/bit with 1.5dB insertion loss and 8dB extinction ratio. We also demonstrate the first infrared detectors in a zero-change CMOS process, using absorption in transistor source/drain SiGe stressors. Subsystems described include the first monolithically integrated electronic-photonic transmitter on chip (modulator+driver) with 20-70fJ/bit wall plug energy/bit (2-3.5Gbps), to our knowledge the lowest transmitter energy demonstrated to date. We also demonstrate native-process infrared receivers at 220fJ/bit (5Gbps). These are encouraging signs for the prospects of monolithic electronics-photonics integration. Beyond processor-to-memory interconnects, our approach to photonics as a Morethan- Moore technology inside advanced CMOS promises to enable VLSI electronic-photonic chip platforms tailored to a vast array of emerging applications, from optical and acoustic sensing, high-speed signal processing, RF and optical metrology and clocks, through to analog computation and quantum technology.",,10.1117/12.2084604,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2084604,Conference Paper

This paper has a detailed study directed towards designing of In(0.29)Ga(0.71)AS(0.99)N(0.01)/GaAs straddled nanoscale-heterostructure having a single QW of thickness 60A and optimization of optical and lasing characteristics such as optical and mode gain, differential gain, gain compression, anti-guiding factor, transparency wavelength, relaxation oscillation frequency (ROF), optical power and their mutual variation behavior. The outcomes of the simulation study imply that for the carrier concentration of similar to 2 x 10(18)cm(-3) the optical gain of the nano-heterostructure is of 2100cm(-1) at the wavelength is of 1.30 mu m. Though the obtained gain is almost half of the gain of InGaAlAs/InP heterostructure, but from the wavelength point of view the InGaAsN/GaAs nano-heterostructure is also more desirable because the 1.30 mu m wavelength is attractive due to negligible dispersion in the silica based optical fiber. Hence, the InGaAsN/GaAs nano-heterostructure can be very valuable in optical fiber based communication systems. (C) 2018 Association of Polish Electrical Engineers (SEP). Published by Elsevier B.V.

They are made by a combination of carbon and heteroatoms typically organized in system-specific structures of different complexity. This peculiarity hampers the application of standard force field parameters and their in silico study by means of atomistic simulations. Here, we combine quantum-mechanics and atomistic free-energy calculations to achieve an improved parametrization of the ligand torsion angles with respect to the state-of-the-art force fields in the paradigmatic molecular binding system benzamidine/trypsin. Funnel-Metadynamics calculations with the new parameters greatly reproduced the high-resolution crystallographic ligand binding mode and allowed a more accurate description of the binding mechanism, when the ligand might assume specific conformations to cross energy barriers.

Ions play a crucial role in the structure of the surrounding network of water molecules as they can either weaken or strengthen it. Gaining a thorough understanding of the underlying forces from small clusters to bulk solutions is still challenging, which motivates further investigations. Through a systematic analysis of the interaction energies obtained from high-level electronic structure methodologies, we assessed various dispersion-corrected density functional approaches, as well as ab initio-based data-driven potential models for halide ion-water clusters. We introduced an active learning scheme to automate the generation of optimally weighted datasets, required for the development of efficient bottom-up anion-water models. Using an evolutionary programming procedure, we determined optimized and reference configurations for such polarizable and first-principles-based representation of the potentials, and we analyzed their structural characteristics and energetics in comparison with estimates from DF-MP2 and DFT+D quantum chemistry computations. Moreover, we presented new benchmark datasets, considering both equilibrium and non-equilibrium configurations of higher-order species with an increasing number of water molecules up to 54 for each F, Cl, Br, and I anions, and we proposed a validation protocol to cross-check methods and approaches. In this way, we aim to improve the predictive ability of future molecular computer simulations for determining the ongoing conflicting distribution of different ions in aqueous environments, as well as the transition from nanoscale clusters to macroscopic condensed phases.",,10.3390/molecules27051654,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules27051654,Journal

A wide variety of strategies have been applied for the controlled synthesis and for achieving the intended doping/co-doping levels in the carbon network of graphene-based materials. Precise and reproducible doping is crucial for altering the Fermi energy level and to tune the band gap according to the desired device/application. Heteroatom-doped and co-doped graphene-based materials (n-type and p-type doping) have been synthesized for devices in energy-related applications using various chemical and physical routes. In this review article, we survey the most recent research works on the synthesis of heteroatom-doped graphene materials such as reduced graphene oxide, graphene oxide, graphene quantum dots and graphene nanoribbons. Applications of these materials in energy storage/conversion devices (supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, water splitting and solar cells) are also reviewed.

A TiO2/SiO2 dielectric distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and an aluminum metal reflector were employed as top and bottom mirrors, respectively. As compared to the conventional LED without a top mirror, improved performances were achieved in RCLED devices due to the resonant cavity effect.

The reflection spectrum of each cavity can be efficiently tailored by changing the doping level of the graphene. Specifically, more than 270 degrees, 240 degrees, and 180 degrees of phase shifts are produced near the first, second, and third resonances, respectively. With such a significant degree of freedom for the response phases, we demonstrate three different strategies to organize the array, viz., 4, 3, and 2 GFPC cells-based periodic lattices were designed, respectively, to generate particular propagating directions of the reflection waves. Compared with the metal resonant structures, our scheme is convenient for obtaining the multi-scanning angle and multi-frequency properties.

Swarm Intelligence (SI), a major branch of artificial intelligence, was rendered to model the collective behavior of social swarms in nature. Ultimately, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is arguably one of the most popular SI paradigms. Over the past two decades, PSO has been applied successfully, with good return as well, in a wide variety of fields of science and technology with a wider range of complex optimization problems, thereby occupying a prominent position in the optimization field. However, through indepth studies, a number of problems with the algorithm have been detected and identified; e.g., issues regarding convergence, diversity, and stability. Consequently, since its birth in the mid-1990s, PSO has witnessed a myriad of enhancements, extensions, and variants in various aspects of the algorithm, specifically after the twentieth century, and the related research has therefore now reached an impressive state. In this paper, a rigorous yet systematic review is presented to organize and summarize the information on the PSO algorithm and the developments and trends of its most basic as well as of some of the very notable implementations that have been introduced recently, bearing in mind the coverage of paradigm, theory, hybridization, parallelization, complex optimization, and the diverse applications of the algorithm, making it more accessible. Ease for researchers to determine which PSO variant is currently best suited or to be invented for a given optimization problem or application.

(2020),2020,Lithium niobate photonic-crystal electro-optic modulator,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Modern advanced photonic integrated circuits require dense integration of high-speed electro-optic functional elements on a compact chip that consumes only moderate power. Energy efficiency, operation speed, and device dimension are thus crucial metrics underlying almost all current developments of photonic signal processing units. Recently, thin-film lithium niobate (LN) emerges as a promising platform for photonic integrated circuits. Here, we make an important step towards miniaturizing functional components on this platform, reporting high-speed LN electro-optic modulators, based upon photonic crystal nanobeam resonators. The devices exhibit a significant tuning efficiency up to 1.98 GHz V-1, a broad modulation bandwidth of 17.5 GHz, while with a tiny electro-optic modal volume of only 0.58 mu m(3). The modulators enable efficient electro-optic driving of high-Q photonic cavity modes in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes, and allow us to achieve electro-optic switching at 11 Gb s(-1) with a bit-switching energy as low as 22 fJ. The demonstration of energy efficient and high-speed electro-optic modulation at the wavelength scale paves a crucial foundation for realizing large-scale LN photonic integrated circuits that are of immense importance for broad applications in data communication, microwave photonics, and quantum photonics. Lithium niobate (LN) devices are promising for future photonic integrated circuits.

This obvious difficulty is one of the most common obstacles in application of ANN-based QSAR models for design of potent antioxidants or elucidating the underlying mechanism. Interpreting the resulting models is often omitted or performed erroneously altogether. In this work, a comprehensive comparative study of six methods (PaD, PaD2, weights, stepwise, perturbation and profile) for exploration and interpretation of ANN models built for prediction of Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) QM descriptors, is presented. Sum of ranking differences (SRD) was used for ranking of the six methods with respect to the contributions of the calculated QM molecular descriptors toward TEAC. The results show that the PaD, PaD2 and profile methods are the most stable and give rise to realistic interpretation of the observed correlations. Therefore, they are safely applicable for future interpretations without the opinion of an experienced chemist or bio-analyst.

The development began at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) in 2005, and the manufacturing and testing of all the receivers to be installed in the 66 Cassegrain reflector antennas that compose ALMA was completed in 2013. This enabled the terahertz frequency observations with the highest sensitivity from the ground. To meet the stringent ALMA requirements, terahertz SIS mixers with high-quality superconducting NbTiN films were developed, which successfully demonstrated an unpreceded noise performance less than 230 K (5 times the quantum noise) for all the receivers. After the construction of ALMA, NAOJ began development studies for ALMA enhancement such as wideband and multibeam SIS receivers according to top-level science requirements. To increase instantaneous bandwidth of the receivers, a submillimeter-wave multiband receiver concept with a waveguide multiplexer, wideband intermediate frequency SIS-mixer-amplifier, and multifrequency local oscillator (LO) source is presented. The multibeam receiver employs a planar-integrated SIS mixer circuit that includes all the RF components except the LO distribution network and an SIS-mixer-based amplifier of low power consumption, which is expected to enable the wide field-of-view observations in the future.",,10.1029/2020RS007157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020RS007157,Journal

Various optical properties like refractive index, extinction coefficient, optical band gap, real and imaginary parts of dielectric constants have been evaluated using the transmission spectrum. The optical band gap of the synthesized samples has shown similar trend with the band gap determined theoretically. The average coordination number has been found to increase whereas the number of lone pair electron is found to decrease. This shows that the system under investigation is moving towards more rigid region as per constraint theory.

Due to the chemical reforming on the bonding or precipitating feature of the compositional atoms in the membrane matrix, either the orbital hybridization or the quantum self-assembly of interstitial composites can be employed to reform the electronic and optical characteristics. The recent development on enhancing the nonlinear refractive indices of the group-IV semiconductor materials has revealed significant progress to accelerate the all-optical switching logic, which greatly reduces the energy consumption to enable the constitution of the advanced multi-logic gating and the entry-level photonic computing circuits. This work not only overviews the group-IV semiconductor photonic data processing elements but also prospects for the future direction of optical quantum computation and communication. To date, the nonlinear refractive indices of the group-IV semiconductor materials can be obtained as 10(-8) to 10(-16) cm(2)/W in the range between 300 and 10 000 nm in 2022. The wavelength conversion and data switching with bit rate beyond 25 Gbps have been achieved via nonlinear photonic waveguide components. By taking the non-stoichiometric SiC-made micro-ring waveguide as an example, the n(2) as high as 3.05 x 10(-14) cm(2)/W of the resonant SiC micro-ring gate is retrieved from the pump-probe analysis. The eye-diagram of the wavelength converted data in the micro-ring achieves its signal-to-noise and on/off-extinction ratios (SNR and ER) of 5.6 and 11.8 dB, while up to 25-Gbps all-optical data-format inversion with 4.8-dB SNR and 10.2-dB ER is also performed during an ultrafast switching within rising and falling time of less than 22 ps. Such all-optical data processing including both wavelength switching and format conversion in the highly nonlinear optical SiC waveguide resonator can achieve error-free operation with corresponding bit-error-ratios of lower than 1 x 10(-5) at 25 Gbps after forward error correction.

One of the main challenges is the relatively poor absorption of photons by photosystems due to narrow absorption spectra, reflection, and respiration. Although most studies focused on increasing the harvesting of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), engineering photon absorption in photosynthesis is another important pathway to pursue for enhancement of photosynthetic solar energy harvesting. Here, plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) from plasmonic nanoparticles to thylakoid membranes (TMs) is proposed to stimulate photosynthesis and increase production of PEs. Gold nanorods (AuNRs), which have a plasmon resonance peak close to 680 nm, are selected to increase the production of high energy PEs by PRET. With AuNR conjugation to spinach TMs, light-triggered PE currents increase to the magnitude 4 fold larger than the currents without the plasmonic AuNRs. Biophotovoltaic (BPV) cells were prepared with the plasmon-enhanced spinach TMs, and they were connected in series and with a capacitor for charge accumulation.

We utilized the UCLA-Red Hen Lab multi-billion-word repository of video recordings, all of them showing communicative behavior that was not elicited in a lab, to quantify speech-gesture co-occurrence frequency for a subset of linguistic expressions in American English. First, we objectively establish a systematic relationship in the high degree of co-occurrence between gesture and speech in our subset of expressions, which consists of temporal phrases. Second, we show that there is a systematic alignment between the informativity of co-speech gestures and that of the verbal expressions with which they co-occur. By exposing deep, systematic relations between the modalities of gesture and speech, our results pave the way for the data-driven integration of multimodal behavior into our understanding of human communication.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0233892,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233892,Journal

Transition metal dichalcogenides OsSe2 crystallized in pyrite-type structure with space group Pa-3 (#205) has been taken. Using the ab initio approach within the framework of generalized gradient approximation in the Quantum-Espresso simulation package, we have shown that the compound OsSe2 is semimetal and behaves like a topological non-trivial material.

(2015),2015,DFT plus U studies of Cu doping and p-type compensation in crystalline and amorphous ZnS,PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,"Zinc sulfide is an excellent candidate for the development of a p-type transparent conducting material that has great demands in solar energy and optoelectronic applications. Doping with Cu is one potential way to make ZnS p-type while preserving its optical transparency for the solar spectrum; however, this is limited by the extremely low solubility of Cu in ZnS and charge compensation mechanisms that eliminate the p-type characteristics. These mechanisms are different in crystalline (c-ZnS) and amorphous structures (a-ZnS), leading to different tendencies of doping Cu in these two ZnS phases, as well as the feasibility to form the p-type material. In this work, we have carried out fundamental studies of Cu doping in both c-ZnS and a-ZnS, using the continuous random network model and density functional theory with Hubbard's energy correction (DFT+U). The formation of a complex that contains two Cu-zn and one S vacancy is highly favorable in both phases. The local environment of this charge-compensated Cu complex obtained by DFT calculations agrees well with the previous EXAFS measurements. The incorporation of Cu into a-ZnS, on the one hand, is more tolerable compared to its crystal counterparts (zincblende), indicating possible higher Cu concentration. On the other hand, there is aka another intrinsic mechanism to compensate the p-type characteristics in a-ZnS: the formation of the covalent S-S dumbbell units. This reconstruction of the local structure to form a S S bond could occur spontaneously, thus making the p-type doping for ZnS challenging even in the amorphous phase.",,10.1039/c5cp04623h,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cp04623h,Journal

(2017),2017,Direct Evidence of Intrinsic Blue Fluorescence from Oligomeric Interfaces of Human Serum Albumin,LANGMUIR,"The molecular origin behind the concentration-dependent intrinsic blue fluorescence of human serum albumin (HSA) is not known yet. This unusual blue fluorescence is believed to be a characteristic feature of amyloid-like fibrils of protein/peptide and originates due to the delocalization of peptide bond electrons through the extended hydrogen bond networks of cross-beta-sheet structure. Herein, by combining the results of spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoresis, and confocal microscopy, we have shown that the intrinsic blue fluorescence of HSA exclusively originates from oligomeric interfaces devoid of any amyloid-like fibrillar structure. Our study suggests that this low energy fluorescence band is not due to any particular residue/sequence, but rather it is a common feature of self assembled peptide bonds. The present findings of intrinsic blue fluorescence from oligomeric interfaces pave the way for future applications of this unique visual phenomenon for early stage detection of various protein aggregation related human diseases.",,10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b02463,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b02463,Journal

Here, an all-optical method that uses the spin-sensitive optical Stark effect is proposed to manipulate exciton-polaritons for functional polaritonic operations. We use a Tamm plasmon and WS2 hybrid structure with a patterned transverse potential to form the channeled bright state of polaritons. An optical Stark pulse causes perturbation of the polaritonic potential, so as to control the tunneling of polaritons between isolated channels. Polaritonic operations such as switching, splitting and routing were proposed through properly setting of the optical Stark pulse (e.g., pulse width). In addition, spin-sensitive manipulation of the polaritons was proposed taking advantage of the valley-selective excitonic energy shifting induced by the polarized optical Stark pulse. These basic operations together with time-space programming of the optical Stark pulses would pave a way of routing and addressing of polaritons for future optoelectronic integration and networking.",,10.1039/c8nr09091b,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8nr09091b,Journal

Analyses of spin-spin relaxation time (T-2), by combining free-induction decay (FID), magic-sandwich echo-FID, and Hahn-echo experiments demonstrate a reduction in crystal-amorphous interface regions of pure ultralow-density polyethylene (ULDPE) upon curative addition. The blends demonstrate a complete loss of these fractions due to curative-induced plasticization and solvation by polyethylene segments of EPDM. Cross-link densities, quantified by the magnitude of residual dipolar coupling constant (D-res), arising from topological restrictions to segmental motions, are measured by multiple-quantum experiments. The entanglement-dominated EPDMs demonstrate a significant reduction in ultimate tensile properties with increasing D-res. The analogous blends yield similar D-res values up to 0.36 phr of free sulfur. Thereafter, a deviation from the cross-linking trend of the EPDMs is observed with the blends approaching a cross-linking limit, thus emphasizing the migration of additives to the amorphous phase of the ULDPE. From the additional contributions of solvation and complex entanglement scenarios in the blends, restoration and even significant enhancement in ultimate tensile strength are achieved. Limitations in applying the popular Mooney-Rivlin analysis are also briefly discussed.",,10.1002/mame.202100968,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mame.202100968,Journal

Herein, with the purpose to integrate spherical geometry and optoelectronic properties, the first phosphine oxide (PO) bridge-ring host 5,10-[1,2]benzenophosphanthrene 5,10-dioxide (BPAO2) with phosphorus as bridgehead atom is demonstrated. The sphere-like paddle-wheel configuration of BPAO2 gives rise to the highly ordered layer-by-layer packing mode, owing to its single molecular orientation, which provides the weak pi-pi interactions in each layer and hydrogen bond networks between layers. These limited but sufficient interactions are preserved in dilute solution and vacuum-evaporated film, balancing the charge transportation and the quenching suppression. As consequence, its blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) diodes achieve the record-low turn-on voltage as 2.3 V, which is remarkably below blue photon energy (approximate to 2.6 eV), and the power efficiency up to approximate to 70 lm W-1.

Unlike the turing machine (TM), PM is a fully parallel computing model in the sense that it can simultaneously process multiple pairs of data, rather than sequentially process every pair of linearly adjacent data. We establish the mathematical model of PM as a nine-tuple consisting of data library, probe library, data controller, probe controller, probe operation, computing platform, detector, true solution storage, and residue collector. We analyze the computation capability of the PM model, and in particular, we show that TM is a special case of PM. We revisit two NP-complete problems, i.e., the graph coloring and Hamilton cycle problems, and devise two algorithms on basis of the established PM model, which can enumerate all solutions to each of these problems by only one probe operation. Furthermore, we show that PM can be implemented by leveraging the nano-DNA probe technologies. The computational power of an electronic computer based on TM is known far more than that of the human brain.

(2018),2018,Tripartite-to-Bipartite Entanglement Transformation by Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication and the Structure of Matrix Spaces,COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS,"We study the problem of transforming a tripartite pure state to a bipartite one using stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). It is known that the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC convertibility is characterized by the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state, i.e. the largest Schmidt rank over those bipartite states lying in the support of the reduced density operator. In this paper, we further study this problem and exhibit novel results in both multi-copy and asymptotic settings, utilizing powerful results from the structure of matrix spaces. In the multi-copy regime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of two tripartite pure states can be strictly larger than the product of their maximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full characterization of those tripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative when taking tensor product with itself. Notice that such tripartite states admit strict advantages in tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC transformation when multiple copies are provided. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on determining the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC entanglement transformation rate. Computing this rate turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic maximal Schmidt rank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal Schmidt rank. Despite the difficulty caused by the super-multiplicative property, we provide explicit formulas for evaluating the asymptotic maximal Schmidt ranks of two important families of tripartite pure states by resorting to certain results of the structure of matrix spaces, including the study of matrix semi-invariants. These formulas turn out to be powerful enough to give a sufficient and necessary condition to determine whether a given tripartite pure state can be transformed to the bipartite maximally entangled state under SLOCC, in the asymptotic setting. Applying the recent progress on the non-commutative rank problem, we can verify this condition in deterministic polynomial time.",,10.1007/s00220-017-3077-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00220-017-3077-5,Journal

(2022),2022,Octagonal-siloxane based transparent and robust crack-healing surface for optical-scar recovery,MATERIALS & DESIGN,"Siloxane derivatives are a class of emerging hybrid materials that provide optical transparency and mechanically flexible characteristics owing to the low rotational barrier of the framework. To devise a robust and flexible self-healing platform, we designed an octagonal-siloxane derivative with four furan units and applied bifunctional maleimides as dienophiles to implement the reversible Diels-Alder (DA) reaction for crack healing. The feasibility of the DA reaction was confirmed by both the appearance of a cyclohexyl moiety in H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and heat transition behaviors during heating-cooling cycles in differential scanning calorimetry. The crack-healing efficiency of the designed octagonal-siloxane was sensitively affected by the heat-treatment temperature, and the crack recovery rate reached over 95% within 60 s upon heating at 100 degrees C. In addition, the crack recovery tendency was almost intact during repetitive heating-cooling cycles. The devised crack-healing film exhibited greater than 95% transparency in the entire visible region, and the effective modulus reached 7.8 GPa. In particular, when CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were embedded into the octagonal-siloxane based film, it was confirmed that optical scars exhibiting luminescence defects were effectively recovered, and the emission characteristics of the QDs were not critically compromised even under solvent-exposed circumstances.

This study explores the feasibility of using an advanced THz-QCL device for measuring the absolute leaf water content in Corylus avellana L., Laurus nobilis L., Ostrya carpinifolia Scop., Quercus ilex L., Quercus suber L., and Vitis vinifera L.

A recently proposed, simple spectroscopic technique was used, consisting in determining the transmission of the THz light beam through the leaf combined with a photographic measurement of the leaf area. A significant correlation was found between the product of the leaf optical depth (tau) and the leaf surface area (L-A) with the leaf water mass (M-w) for all the studied species (Pearson's r test, p <= 0.05). In all cases, the best fit regression line, in the graphs of tau L-A as a function of M-w, displayed R-2 values always greater than 0.85. The method proposed can be combined with water stress indices of plants in order to gain a better understanding of the leaf water management processes or to indirectly monitor the kinetics of leaf invasion by pathogenic bacteria, possibly leading to the development of specific models to study and fight them.",,10.3390/s19224838,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19224838,Journal

Zhifeng Zhang and co-workers from the US, Italy, and Spain fabricated an InGaAsP microring laser embedded in Si(3)N(4)using electron-beam lithography, inductively coupled plasma etching, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. By spatially selective optical pumping with 140-fs duration, 800-nm wavelength laser pulses, an InGaAsP waveguide on the chip couples with the microring at three points and feeds it with dynamically varying optical gain to tune the state of OAM of the microring laser's output between a charge value of 0 and +2 within 100 ps. The tuning speed and range of achievable OAM values could likely be improved in the future, according to the researchers. On-chip integrated laser sources of structured light carrying fractional orbital angular momentum (FOAM) are highly desirable for the forefront development of optical communication and quantum information-processing technologies. While integrated vortex beam generators have been previously demonstrated in different optical settings, ultrafast control and sweep of FOAM light with low-power control, suitable for high-speed optical communication and computing, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate fast control of the FOAM from a vortex semiconductor microlaser based on fast transient mixing of integer laser vorticities induced by a control pulse. A continuous FOAM sweep between charge 0 and charge +2 is demonstrated in a 100 ps time window, with the ultimate speed limit being established by the carrier recombination time in the gain medium.

Comparing how these enzymes achieve their reaction promiscuity can yield valuable insights to develop functions from the optimization of latent activities.

The study, combining multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, deep machine learning approaches, and experimental characterization of Bs2 kinetics, confirms the amidase activity of Bs2 and CALB. The computational results indicate that both enzymes offer a slightly different reaction environment reflected by electrostatic effects within the active site, thus resulting in a different reaction mechanism during the acylation step. A convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used to understand the conserved amino acids among the evolved protein family and suggest that Bs2 provides a more robust protein scaffold to perform future mutagenesis studies.

Meeting future domestic needs and benefiting by access to a large global market of space will require a quantum jump in capabilities and capacities to be served. Another important development is the aspirational growth of the Indian economy and the people. With agross domestic product (GDP) growth hovering around 7%-8% and a few trillion dollar economy, the nation has launched important developmental initiativesDigital India, Make in India, Smart City, Swach Bharat, National Education Mission, and National Skill Mission programs. Thus, demands for diverse applications of space technology are inevitable, integrating across geographical, sectoral, and temporal domains of the country. In an earlier suo-moto study, we have outlined the future 10-20 years of policy perspectives for Indian Space development and also outlined the perspectives of how a national space ecosystem would emerge, evolving from the present national space agency into a public-private-academia triad. Looking ahead into such a national ecosystem, we now visualize critical developments that will bring impacting and paradigm shifts to holistic Indian Space through the triadgame changers. With about 100-150 possible missions in the coming 10-20 yearsencompassing earth observation, satellite communications, positioning, space science, planetary missions, operational and advanced launch access missions, and the initiation of a human spaceflight programthe critical shifts would be not just technological advancements but also organizational restructuring from emerging newer organizational arrangements, industrialization and emergence of private space industry, deeper penetration of space services in Indian society, increasing global presence of Indian players, and a vibrant cooperative and collaboration at the international level. What will drive these game changers? Cost efficiency will be one key driver amply demonstrated in many sectors for global markets; this will impact global space markets and bring a leveling effect across global markets. Indian skills and human resources will be another driver, with Indian scientists, engineers, and managers playing a major role in the national and global space.

Stage Setting",ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"We begin our tripartite Essay with a triangle of understanding, theory and simulation. Sketching the intimate tie between explanation and teaching, we also point to the emotional impact of understanding. As we trace the development of theory in chemistry, Dirac's characterization of what is known and what is needed for theoretical chemistry comes up, as does the role of prediction, and Thom's phrase To predict is not to explain. We give a typology of models, and then describe, no doubt inadequately, machine learning and neural networks. In the second part, we leave philosophy, beginning by describing Roald's being beaten by simulation. This leads us to artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens' account of what a go-playing program knows. Back to our terrain-we ask Quantum Chemistry, dagger ca. 2020? Then move to examples of AI affecting social matters, ranging from trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer.

Back and forth is how it should be-between painfully-obtained, intriguing numbers, begging for interpretation, in turn requiring new concepts, new models, new theoretically grounded tools of computation. Through such iterations understanding is formed. As our tripartite Essay ends, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact-seekers, and searchers for understanding.

The feasibility of contemporary gas-grain astrochemical models depends on the availability of accurate kinetics data, in particular, for surface processes. Aims. We study the sensitivity of gas-grain chemical models to the energy barrier E-a of the important surface reaction between some of the most abundant species: C and H-2 (surface C + surface H-2 -> surface CH2). Methods. We used the gas-grain code ALCHEMIC to model the time-dependent chemical evolution over a 2D grid of densities (n(H) is an element of 10(3), 10(12) cm(-3)) and temperatures (T is an element of 10, 300 K), assuming UV-dark (A(V) = 20 mag) and partly UV-irradiated (A(V) = 3 mag) conditions that are typical of the dense interstellar medium. We considered two values for the energy barrier of the surface reaction, E-a = 2500 K (as originally implemented in the networks) and E-a = 0 K (as measured in the laboratory and computed by quantum chemistry simulations). Results. We find that if the C + H-2 -> CH2 surface reaction is barrierless, a more rapid conversion of the surface carbon atoms into methane ice occurs. Overproduction of the CHn hydrocarbon ices affects the surface formation of more complex hydrocarbons, cyanides and nitriles, and CS-bearing species at low temperatures less than or similar to 10-15 K. The surface hydrogenation of CO and hence the synthesis of complex (organic) molecules become affected as well. As a result, important species whose abundances may change by more than a factor of two at 1 Myr include atomic carbon, small mono-carbonic (C-1) and di-carbonic (C-2) hydrocarbons, CO2, CN, HCN, HNC, HNCO, CS, H2CO, H2CS, CH2CO, and CH3OH (in either gas and/or ice). The abundances of key species, CO, H2O, and N-2 as well as O, HCO+, N2H+, NH3, NO, and most of the S-bearing molecules, remain almost unaffected. Conclusions.

When compared with exact diagonalization performed on small clusters, we demonstrate that for strong disorder this technique approaches the exact result on all available timescales, while for intermediate disorder, in the vicinity of the many-body localization transition, it produces quantitatively accurate results up to nontrivial times. Our method allows for the treatment of system sizes inaccessible by any numerically exact method and for the complete elimination of finite-size effects for the times considered. We show that for a sufficiently strong disorder the system becomes nonergodic, while for intermediate disorder strengths and for all accessible timescales transport in the system is strictly subdiffusive. We argue that these results are incompatible with a simple percolation picture, but are consistent with the heuristic random resistor network model where subdiffusion may be observed for long times until a crossover to diffusion occurs.

As a result, they exhibit a wide variety of intriguing physical phenomena and have useful properties in various settings. In the nearly 50 years since the discovery of the first meltprocessable LCPs, there has been a remarkable expansion in the field encompassing the development of new chain architectures, the incorporation of new classes of mesogens, and the exploration of new properties and applications. As engineering materials, LCPs are historically best known in the context of high strength fibers. In a more contemporary study, the pairing of LC mesophase assembly with block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly in LC BCPs has resulted in a fascinating interplay of ordering phenomena and rich phase behavior, while lightly crosslinked networks, LC elastomers, are extensively investigated as shape memory materials based on their thermomechanical actuation. As this Viewpoint describes, these and other examples are active areas of research in which new, compelling opportunities for LCPs are emerging. We highlight a few selected areas that we view as being potentially significant in the near future, with a particular emphasis on nanopatterning. Here, the ability to readily access small feature sizes, the fluidity of the LC mesophase, and LC-based handles for achieving orientation control present a compelling combination. Opportunities for LCPs are also presented under the broad rubric of beyond nanopatterning, and we discuss relevant challenges and potential new directions in the field.",,10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00350,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00350,Journal

2352,WOS,Mishin (2021),2021,Machine-learning interatomic potentials for materials science,ACTA MATERIALIA,"Large-scale atomistic computer simulations of materials rely on interatomic potentials providing computationally efficient predictions of energy and Newtonian forces. Traditional potentials have served in this capacity for over three decades. Recently, a new class of potentials has emerged, which is based on a radically different philosophy. The new potentials are constructed using machine-learning (ML) methods and a massive reference database generated by quantum-mechanical calculations. While the traditional potentials are derived from physical insights into the nature of chemical bonding, the ML potentials utilize a high-dimensional mathematical regression to interpolate between the reference energies. We review the current status of the interatomic potential field, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the traditional and ML potentials. A third class of potentials is introduced, in which an ML model is coupled with a physics-based potential to improve the transferability to unknown atomic environments. The discussion is focused on potentials intended for materials science applications. Possible future directions in this field are outlined. (c) 2021 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(2019),2019,Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality from quantum chemistry to drug binding: An open-source multi-person framework,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,"As molecular scientists have made progress in their ability to engineer nanoscale molecular structure, we face new challenges in our ability to engineer molecular dynamics (MD) and flexibility. Dynamics at the molecular scale differs from the familiar mechanics of everyday objects because it involves a complicated, highly correlated, and three-dimensional many-body dynamical choreography which is often nonintuitive even for highly trained researchers. We recently described how interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) can help to meet this challenge, enabling researchers to manipulate real-time MD simulations of flexible structures in 3D. In this article, we outline various efforts to extend immersive technologies to the molecular sciences, and we introduce  Narupa, a flexible, open-source, multiperson iMD-VR software framework which enables groups of researchers to simultaneously cohabit real-time simulation environments to interactively visualize and manipulate the dynamics of molecular structures with atomic-level precision. We outline several application domains where iMD-VR is facilitating research, communication, and creative approaches within the molecular sciences, including training machines to learn potential energy functions, biomolecular conformational sampling, protein-ligand binding, reaction discovery using  on-the-fly quantum chemistry, and transport dynamics in materials. We touch on iMD-VR's various cognitive and perceptual affordances and outline how these provide research insight for molecular systems. By synergistically combining human spatial reasoning and design insight with computational automation, technologies such as iMD-VR have the potential to improve our ability to understand, engineer, and communicate microscopic dynamical behavior, offering the potential to usher in a new paradigm for engineering molecules and nano-architectures.

The Se-CQD/DOAPA binary mixture exhibited abundant phase behavior, in which an isotropic phase (I1) was first observed, followed by turbidity (T), precipitation (P), and a second isotropic phase (I2), as the DOAPA concentration increased. Then we focused on investigating the morphologies of samples. In cryo-TEM observations, spherical aggregates were observed in all phase sequences, whereas the aggregates have different zeta potentials and sizes. In the I2 phase, interesting nanocapsule-like aggregates and spindle-like aggregates can be identified in addition to spherical aggregates. In combination with the rheological behaviors of the I2 phase solution and the detailed structure of the aggregates from enlarged cryo-TEM images, it is possible that the Se-CQDs and DOAPA co-assemble with novel network-like building blocks. The turbid solutions were found to be responsive to pH in phase P, and spherical aggregates were obtained at pH 6.5 but turned into vesicles when the pH reached 5.0. On the basis of these findings, CQDs and surfactants can be good structural building blocks for supramolecular structures, and the diverse morphologies of aggregates offer the prospect of multiple applications in the future.",,10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01895,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01895,Journal

New tavaborole biologically active derivatives, namely 5-fluoro-3-morpholin-4-yl-2,1-benzoxaborol-1(3H)-ol and 5-fluoro-3-thiomorpholin-4-yl-2,1-benzoxaborol-1(3H)-ol have been synthesized and their crystal structures are discussed in comparison to the parent tavaborole and nonfluorinated benzoxaborole analogs. Our aim is to find the structural differences caused by the substitution with the fluorine atom, the introduction of a substituent at position 3, and its modification at a peripheral site. For this purpose, we have employed state-of-art tools using knowledge-based and quantum crystallography algorithms. Our study revealed that the presence of the fluorine atom reduces both the molecular dipole moment and the hydrogen bond acceptor abilities of a ring oxygen atom, hence affecting the structure of the main hydrogen-bonded motif. The analysis shows that in the new thiomorpholine derivative, the observed motif is not optimal, and thus other polymorphs might be sought. Hierarchical analysis of weak intermolecular interactions and elucidation of large supramolecular synthons allowed us to find similarities in the networks formed by 3-substituted derivatives and their different arrangement compared to unsubstituted benzoxaboroles. This approach gives an insight into weak interaction cooperativity and their exchange upon different substitutions. The results may serve as a basis for future search for new polymorphic forms and benzoxaborole derivative multicomponent crystals.",,10.1039/d2ce00279e,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ce00279e,Journal

As a 2D atomic layer of sp2 over line hybridized carbon arranged in a hexagonal network, graphene is regarded as a promising material for nanoelectronics owing to its high crystallinity and interesting semimetal electronic properties. In addition, graphene has extremely strong perception ability and high selectivity for different stimuli, and graphene over line based materials have been widely used as key perceiving materials of artificial flexible sensors to imitate the flexibility and stretchability of human skin, which is one of the most promising wearable and sensing materials for potential commercialization. This paper first introduces the main working mechanisms of piezoresistive type, capacitive type, piezoelectric type and transistor type, as well as the key performance evaluation parameters such as sensitivity, detection range, response speed and so on of sensors. At the same time, the advantages and synthesis methods of graphene materials are also briefly summarized. In conjunction of our recent research works of graphene over line based composite materials made up of graphene and polyaniline, Ag nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, Ni(OH) 2( II) and quantum dots for flexible sensors, this paper then reviews the applications of graphene over line based single function flexible sensors in detecting pressure, strain, temperature, humidity, chemical molecules, biomolecules, gas and other fields, as well as several graphene over line based multifunctional flexible sensors.

We propose research directions and highlight the role of plant architecture in the relative contributions of the root system, leaves, and pods to seed yield. We call for de novo design of new rapeseed crops. We review trait variation in existing germplasm and biotechnologies available for crop design.

Aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors (AASCs) offer numerous economic and environmental benefits. The small voltage of AASCs, however, limits their progress for large-scale industrial applications. AASCs with voltage windows (>2.0 V) have made significant progress in the last few years. Herein, a novel hierarchical alpha-Fe2O3 ultra-thin nanowires grown on rGO aerogel (denoted as alpha-Fe2O3/rGO) composite was designed as the anode. Taking advantage of the rGO aerogel protective layer, the alpha-Fe2O3/rGO anode reveals a prolonged voltage window up to -1.5-0 V, which considerably boosts capacitance up to (270 F g(-1)@1 A g(-1)), and (106.7 F g(-1)@ 10 A g(-1)) along with superb stability owing to the good integration of rGO network and alpha-Fe2O3. Moreover, NiCo2S4 nanosheets coated on alpha-MnO2 nanorods (denoted as NCS/alpha-MnO2) as a protection layer to complement the wide potential cathode, as a result, the NCS/alpha-MnO2 composite displays an optimized voltage window of 0-1.2 V, a high capacitance (594 F g(-1)@1 A g(-1)), and outstanding cycling stability. More importantly, the assembled NCS/alpha-MnO2//alpha-Fe2O3/rGO AASC device functions in an optimized voltage (2.7 V) by means of ultra-high specific energy of 142.1 Wh kg(-1), at the specific power of 1350 W kg(-1) with the downfall of the specific energy of 18.75 Wh kg(-1) at the specific power of 67,500 W kg(-1) with exceptional stability (79% of its initial capacitance retention). Additionally, we demonstrated a single AASC device with enough energy to light a 20 mW green LED and emitted light over 40 s, which opens up possible realistic applications. Finally, this study provides an avenue for fabricating and designing a wide voltage using a compositing technique, which seems to be one of the promising route to increase specific energy of AASCs.",,10.1016/j.est.2021.103343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.103343,Journal

In this work, Mn3O4 nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) are synthesized together through an in-situ hydrothermal route, and then calcined to be a nanocomposite in which Mn3O4 nanoparticles are anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton (designated as Mn3O4/NCDs). Although the carbon content is only 3.9 wt.% in the Mn3O4/NCDs, the NCDs-derived carbon skeleton provides an electrically conductive network and a stable structure. Such a special nanocomposite has a large specific surface area, plenty of active sites, excellent hydrophilicity and good electronic conductivity. Owing to these structural merits, the Mn3O4/NCDs electrode exhibits a preeminent specific capacity of 443.6 mAh g(-1) and 123.3 mAh g(-1) at current densities of 0.1 and 1.5 A g(-1) in ZIBs, respectively, which are far beyond the bare Mn3O4 nanoparticles synthesized under the similar condition. The electrochemical measurement results prove that carbon dots, as a new type of carbon nanomaterials, have strong ability to modify and improve the performance of existing electrode materials, which may push these electrode materials forward to practical applications.",,10.1002/cssc.202102390,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202102390,Journal

For this purpose, a density functional theory modeling approach is employed to predict basic quantum mechanical quantities such as redox potentials, and electronic properties such as electron affinity, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), for a selected set of organic materials. Both the electronic properties and structural information, such as the numbers of oxygen atoms, lithium atoms, boron atoms, carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and aromatic rings, are considered as input variables for the machine learning-based prediction of redox potentials. The large-set of input variables are further downsized using a linear correlation analysis to have six core input variables, namely electron affinity, HOMO, LUMO, HOMO-LUMO gap, the number of oxygen atoms and the number of lithium atoms. The artificial neural network trained using the quasi-Newton method demonstrates a capability for accurately estimating the redox potentials. From the contribution analysis, in which the influence of each input on the target are accessed, we highlight that the electron affinity has the highest contribution to redox potential, followed by the number of oxygen atoms, HOMO-LUMO gap, the number of lithium atoms, LUMO, and HOMO, in order.",,10.1039/c8ra07112h,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra07112h,Journal

(2019),2019,Crypto Accelerators for Power-Efficient and Real-Time on-Chip Implementation of Secure Algorithms,"2019 26TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS (ICECS)","The demand for data exchange is ever growing. Internet of Things (IoT), industry 4.0, smart city and next-generation interconnected vehicles are some examples of scenarios in which a high volume of nodes share data across networks. Hence, the data protection plays a fundamental aspect to avoid disclosure or manipulation of sensitive information and disruption of services, particularly in safety critical applications. On the other hand, also the compute power at disposal of possible attackers and hackers is growing, and next-future post-quantum capabilities will require the usage of longer keys, certificates and digital signatures, to preserve the security level offered by cryptographic functions. This will affect not only the amount of exchange data, but also the computational resources to secure data, increasing processing time, latencies and power consumption, and lowering data rates. In this work, we investigate different implementation strategies to overcome such performance limitations. This work provides a comparison among pure software approach (both on 32b and 64b processors) and hardware-based solutions we developed for FPGA and ASIC System-on- Chip platforms, for the most common symmetric-key and public-key cryptographic algorithms. The proposed hardware accelerators feature one order of magnitude higher throughput (and lower latency) and more than two orders lower power consumption than their software counterparts. A highly configurable cryptographic suite is proposed that can be customized according to the application requirements and thus able to increase as much as possible the efficiency in terms of energy per enciphered bits per second.",,,,Conference Paper

We find that seven of the nine anthraquinone derivatives display partially reversible photodegradation, with 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (Dantron/Chrysazin) having the best photostability and recovery characteristics of all dyes tested in this study. Based on these measurements we predict that a sample of 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone doped into PMMA with a concentration of 9 g l(-1) will have a record setting irreversible inverse quantum efficiency of B-epsilon = 4.56 x 10(9). Additionally, by considering the performance of the different anthraquinone derivatives and their structures, we develop three rules-of-thumb to qualitatively predict the photostability and recovery characteristics of anthraquinone derivatives. These rules-of-thumb will help guide future experiments and molecular modeling in discerning the underlying mechanisms of reversible photodegradation. Finally, we compare our results for disperse orange 11 dye-doped PMMA to the extended Correlated Chromophore Domain Model (eCCDM). While the eCCDM correctly predicts the behavior of the reversible decay component, it fails to correctly predict the behavior of the irreversible degradation component. This implies further modifications to the eCCDM are required.",,10.1039/d0cp05426g,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cp05426g,Journal
2363,WOS,Hu et al.

However, realizing gigahertz-scale frequency shifts with high efficiency, low loss and tunability-in particular using a miniature and scalable device-is challenging because it requires efficient and controllable nonlinear processes. Existing approaches based on acousto-optics(6,15-17), all-optical wave mixing(10,13,18-22) and electro-optics(23-27) are either limited to low efficiencies or frequencies, or are bulky. Furthermore, most approaches are not bi-directional, which renders them unsuitable for frequency beam splitters. Here we demonstrate electro-optic frequency shifters that are controlled using only continuous and single-tone microwaves. This is accomplished by engineering the density of states of, and coupling between, optical modes in ultralow-loss waveguides and resonators in lithium niobate nanophotonics(28). Our devices, consisting of two coupled ring-resonators, provide frequency shifts as high as 28 gigahertz with an on-chip conversion efficiency of approximately 90 per cent. Importantly, the devices can be reconfigured as tunable frequency-domain beam splitters. We also demonstrate a non-blocking and efficient swap of information between two frequency channels with one of the devices. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a scheme for cascaded frequency shifting that allows shifts of 119.2 gigahertz using a 29.8 gigahertz continuous and single-tone microwave signal. Our devices could become building blocks for future high-speed and large-scale classical information processors(7,29) as well as emerging frequency-domain photonic quantum computers(9,11,14). Engineering of the coupling between optical modes in a lithium niobate chip enables the realization of tunable, bi-directional and low-loss electro-optic frequency shifters controlled using only continuous and single-tone microwaves.",,10.1038/s41586-021-03999-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03999-x,Journal

In this work, an in-situ SiNx nano-network has been employed to achieve high quality heteroepitaxial semipolar (11 (2) over bar2) GaN on m-plane sapphire with reduced stacking fault density. This approach involves in-situ deposition of a porous SiNx interlayer on GaN that serves as a nano-mask for the subsequent growth, which starts in the nanometer-sized pores (window regions) and then progresses laterally as well, as in the case of conventional epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO). The inserted SiNx nano-mask effectively prevents the propagation of defects, such as dislocations and stacking faults, in the growth direction and thus reduces their density in the overgrown layers. The resulting semipolar (11 (2) over bar2) GaN layers exhibit relatively smooth surface morphology and improved optical properties (PL intensity enhanced by a factor of 5 and carrier lifetimes by 35% to 85% compared to the reference semipolar (11 (2) over bar2) GaN layer) which approach to those of the c-plane in-situ nano-ELO GaN reference and, therefore, holds promise for light emitting and detecting devices.

By tuning the metalation reaction between tetra-pyridyl-porphyrin molecules and Fe atoms, we have stabilized the so-called initial complex, an intermediate state of the reaction, on Au(111) substrate, and investigated the magnetic property of this complex at a single-molecule level by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. As revealed by inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy in magnetic field, this Fe-porphyrin complex has magnetic anisotropy energy of more than 15 meV with its easy-axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. Two magnetic states with opposite spin directions are discriminated by the dependence of spin-flip excitation energy on magnetic field and are found to have long spin lifetimes. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe atom in this complex, decoupled from Au substrate by a weak ligand field with elongated Fe-N bonds, has a high-spin state S = 2 and a large orbital angular momentum L = 2, which give rise to easy-axis anisotropy perpendicular to the molecular plane and large magnetic anisotropy energy by spin-orbit coupling. Since the Fe atom is protected by the molecular ligand, the complex can be processed at room or even higher temperatures. The reported system may have potential applications in nonvolatile data storage, and our work demonstrates on-surface metalation reactions can be utilized to synthesize organometallic complexes with large magnetic anisotropy.",,10.1021/acsnano.7b06029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b06029,Journal
2366,WOS,Pakhira & Mendoza-Cortes (2019),2019,Intercalation of first row transition metals inside covalent-organic frameworks (COFs): a strategy to fine tune the electronic properties of porous crystalline materials,PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,"Covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as an important class of nano-porous crystalline materials with many potential applications. They are intriguing platforms for the design of porous skeletons with special functionality at the molecular level. However, despite their extraordinary structural tunability, it is difficult to control their electronic properties, thus hindering the potential implementation in electronic devices. A new family of nanoporous materials, COFs intercalated with first row transition metals, is proposed to address this fundamental drawback - the lack of electronic tunability. Using first-principles calculations, we designed 31 new COF materials in silico by intercalating all of the first row transition metals (TMs) with boroxine-linked and triazine-linked COFs: COF-TM-x (where TM = Sc-Zn and x = 3-5). We investigated their structure and electronic properties. Specifically, we predict that the band gap and density of states (DOS) of COFs can be controlled by intercalating first row transition metal atoms (TM: Sc-Zn) and fine tuned by the concentration of TMs. We also found that the d-subshell electron density of the TMs plays a main role in determining the electronic properties of the COFs. Thus intercalated-COFs provide a new strategy to control the electronic properties of materials within a porous network. This work opens up new avenues for the design of TM-intercalated materials with promising future applications in nanoporous electronic devices, where a high surface area coupled with fine-tuned electronic properties is desired.",,10.1039/c8cp07396a,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cp07396a,Journal

However, due to the poor stability and lead toxicity of conventional perovskites, their practical applications and future commercialization are greatly hindered. In this study, all-inorganic lead-free Cs3Cu2I5 microplatelets (MPs) with high crystallinity and stability were successfully synthesized by a dual-source vapor deposition method for the first time. We investigated the effect of growth temperature, pressure and distance between the substrate and sources on the morphology and crystallinity of the MPs in detail. Different from the traditional lead-halide perovskites, the prepared Cs3Cu2I5 MPs show an excellent stability against ultraviolet light irradiation (similar to 60 h), oxygen/moisture (2 months), and heat (300-373 K, 30 cycles). In addition, the Cs3Cu2I5 MPs demonstrate excellent optical characteristics, including a wide bandgap of 3.87 eV, broadband blue emission, large Stokes shift, and strong electron-phonon coupling. It is anticipated that the above results obtained will provide valuable information for the preparation of non-toxic, stable, and highly crystallized Cs3Cu2I5 MPs that can be employed in environment-friendly and reliable optoelectronic devices, such as deep ultraviolet photodetectors and blue light-emitting diodes.",,10.1039/d1tc03578a,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tc03578a,Journal

First, GQDs with abundant functional groups were chosen as the guest, which not only could be used as one of the signal readouts but also served as the antenna ligand to further sensitize the fluorescence of the host Tb/GMP. Upon being excited at 330 nm, the green fluorescence of the Tb/GMP host is highly enhanced, while the blue fluorescence of GQDs is suppressed due to the confinement of the ICP host. With the presence of thiocholine (TCh), an enzymatic product hydrolyzed from acetylthiocholine (ATCh) by AChE, the competitive coordination of Tb3+ between GMP and TCh results in the collapse of the ICP network and thereby the release of GQDs into the solution; thus, the fluorescence of Tb/GMP turns off and the fluorescence of GQDs turns on. The dual-responsive ratiometric fluorescent intensity change leads to the corresponding green-to-blue fluorescent color change obviously, which constitutes a novel mechanism for the colorimetric analysis of AChE. Moreover, when OPs are subsequently introduced, the activity of AChE is blocked, thus preventing the stimulus response of GQD@Tb/GMP ICP nanoparticles, leading to the fluorescent color change from greenish-blue to green, which could also be employed for OP detection. Benefitting from the high sensitivity, good reliability, and the obvious color changes, the method demonstrated here is a promising candidate to realize smartphone-based point-of-use applications, which is of great importance for timely clinical diagnosis and treatment of OPs related to health issues with AChE as an exposure biomarker in less industrialized countries, in remote settings, or even in home care services.",,10.1021/acsami.0c11834,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c11834,Journal
2369,WOS,Walker et al. (2021),2021,Proton Transfer from a Photoacid to a Water Wire: First Principles Simulations and Fast Fluorescence Spectroscopy,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B,"Proton transfer reactions are ubiquitous in chemistry, especially in aqueous solutions. We investigate photoinduced proton transfer between the photoacid 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6trisulfonate (HPTS) and water using fast fluorescence spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Photoexcitation causes rapid proton release from the HPTS hydroxyl. Previous experiments on HPTS/water described the progress from photoexcitation to proton diffusion using kinetic equations with two time constants. The shortest time constant has been interpreted as protonated and photoexcited HPTS evolving into an associated state, where the proton is shared between the HPTS hydroxyl and an originally hydrogen bonded water. The longer time constant has been interpreted as indicating evolution to a solvent separated state where the shared proton undergoes long distance diffusion. In this work, we refine the previous experimental results using very pure HPTS. We then use excited state ab initio molecular dynamics to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism of aqueous excited state proton transfer in HPTS. We find that the initial excitation results in rapid rearrangement of water, forming a strong hydrogen bonded network (a water wire) around HPTS. HPTS then deprotonates in <= 3 ps, resulting in a proton that migrates back and forth along the wire before localizing on a single water molecule. We find a near linear relationship between the emission wavelength and proton-HPTS distance over the simulated time scale, suggesting that the emission wavelength can be used as a ruler for the proton distance. Our simulations reveal that the associated state corresponds to a water wire with a mobile proton and that the diffusion of the proton away from this water wire (to a generalized solvent separated state) corresponds to the longest experimental time constant.",,10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c07254,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c07254,Journal

(2020),2020,Direct visualization of phase-matched efficient second harmonic and broadband sum frequency generation in hybrid plasmonic nanostructures,LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS,"Second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation (SHG and SFG) provide effective means to realize coherent light at desired frequencies when lasing is not easily achievable. They have found applications from sensing to quantum optics and are of particular interest for integrated photonics at communication wavelengths. Decreasing the footprints of nonlinear components while maintaining their high up-conversion efficiency remains a challenge in the miniaturization of integrated photonics. Here we explore lithographically defined AlGaInP nano(micro)structures/Al2O3/Ag as a versatile platform to achieve efficient SHG/SFG in both waveguide and resonant cavity configurations in both narrow- and broadband infrared (IR) wavelength regimes (1300-1600 nm). The effective excitation of highly confined hybrid plasmonic modes at fundamental wavelengths allows efficient SHG/SFG to be achieved in a waveguide of a cross-section of 113 nm x 250 nm, with a mode area on the deep subwavelength scale (lambda(2)/135) at fundamental wavelengths. Remarkably, we demonstrate direct visualization of SHG/SFG phase-matching evolution in the waveguides. This together with mode analysis highlights the origin of the improved SHG/SFG efficiency. We also demonstrate strongly enhanced SFG with a broadband IR source by exploiting multiple coherent SFG processes on 1 mu m diameter AlGaInP disks/Al2O3/Ag with a conversion efficiency of 14.8% MW(-1)which is five times the SHG value using the narrowband IR source. In both configurations, the hybrid plasmonic structures exhibit >1000 enhancement in the nonlinear conversion efficiency compared to their photonic counterparts. Our results manifest the potential of developing such nanoscale hybrid plasmonic devices for state-of-the-art on-chip nonlinear optics applications. Nonlinear optics: plasmonic nanostructures Plasmonic waveguides and microdisk cavities can provide an efficient means of nonlinear wavelength conversion of light in a chip-compatible platform. Zhe Li and coworkers from Ireland, China and Switzerland fabricated nano- and micro-scale waveguides and cavities from the compound semiconductor AlGaInP, which were then transferred to plasmonic substrates composed of SiO2/Si coated with thin layers of metal oxide (Al2O3) and silver (Ag). When pumped with near-infrared light in the 1300 to 1600 nm region, efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) and sum frequency generation (SFG) were observed with a conversion efficiency of up to 14.8% MW-1. Control experiments with the same structures on plain glass substrates indicate that the plasmonic versions offer >1000 times enhancement in the nonlinear conversion efficiency. The results suggest a promising future for integrated optics employing plasmonics.",,10.1038/s41377-020-00414-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41377-020-00414-4,Journal

Combined physical and chemical etching of p-c-Si wafers by (Ar + H-2) plasma in inductively coupled low-pressure plasma CVD produces various nanostructures with subsequent minimization of reflectance. At a reduced temperature, the rate constant of thermal diffusion of atomic-H in the Si-network becomes smaller, leading to enhanced chemical etching reactions that further increase at an elevated RF power. Regrowth of the SiH(n)precursors produced by etching and subsequent hydrogenation in the plasma develops a high density of elongated nano-grass structures, which further align with sharp tipsviaAr(+)ion bombardment and elimination of loosely bound amorphous over-layers, on application of negative dc substrate bias during real-time etching and regrowth.

Here, we introduce a new protonconducting CP, (NH4)(3)[Zr(H2/3PO4)(3)] (ZrP), which consists of one-dimensional zirconium phosphate anionic chains and fully ordered charge-balancing NH4+ cations. X-ray crystallography, neutron powder diffraction, and variable-temperature solid-state NMR spectroscopy suggest that protons are disordered within an inherent hydrogen-bonded infinite chain of acid-base pairs (N-H...O-P), leading to a stable anhydrous proton conductivity of 1.45 X 10(-3) S.cm(-1) at 180 degrees C, one of the highest values among reported intermediate-temperature proton-conducting materials. First-principles and quantum molecular dynamics simulations were used to directly visualize the unique proton transport pathway involving very efficient proton exchange between NH4+ and phosphate pairs, which is distinct from the common guest encapsulation/dehydration/superprotonic transition mechanisms. ZrP as the electrolyte was further assembled into a H-2/O-2 fuel cell, which showed a record-high electrical power density of 12 mW-cm(-2) at 180 degrees C among reported cells assembled from crystalline solid electrolytes, as well as a direct methanol fuel cell for the first time to demonstrate real applications.

The past decade has witnessed a huge demand for new biocompatibility and high-performance glucose biosensors. Non-enzymatic optical glucose sensing using nano/microscaled materials has surged significantly as it provides a direct visualized and cost-effective way to measure glucose concentrations. This review, in a non-exhaustive way, considers some of the recent most important achievements in the glucose-sensitive optical biosensors based upon nano/microscaled materials. Such materials are capable of mimicking the activities of the enzymes which oxidize glucose to release H2O2. The overall framework of the review can be divided into three parts. The first part describes the colorimetric glucose sensing using nano/microscaled materials as enzyme mimics for the oxidation of different chromogenic substrates. In the second part, some recent developments in chromogenic substrate-free fluorescence glucose sensing facilitated by nano/microscaled materials are elaborated.

On the atomic level, water drives complex metal hydrolysis/condensation/speciation, acid-base, ion pairing, and solvation reactions that ultimately direct material assembly pathways. Here, we demonstrate the importance of Nb-polyoxometalate (Nb-POM) speciation in enabling deposition of Nb2O5, LiNbO3, and (Na, K)NbO3 (KNN) from high-concentration solutions, up to 2.5 M Nb for Nb2O5 and similar to 1 M Nb for LiNbO3 and KNN. Deposition of KNN from 1 M Nb concentration represents a potentially important advancment in lead-free piezoelectrics, an application that requires thick films. Solution characterization via small-angle X-ray scattering and Raman spectroscopy described the speciation for all precursor solutions as the [HxNb24O72]((x-24)) POM, as did total pair distribution function analyses of X-ray scattering of amorphous gels prior to conversion to oxides. The tendency of the Nb-24-POM to form extended networks without crystallization leads to conformal and well-adhered films. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, ellipsometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (CFpars) have been widely used to evaluate growth scope and photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton. According to our 2-year monthly monitor datasets in Lake Erhai, a simple but convenient method was established to predict Microcystis blooms and algal cell densities based on a CFpar representing maximal photochemical quantum yield of Photosystems II (PSII) of algae. Generalized linear mixed models, used to identify the key factors related to the phytoplankton biomass in Lake Erhai, showed significant correlations between Chl a concentration and both the light attenuation coefficient and water temperature. We fitted seasonal trends of CFpars (F-v/F-m and Delta F/F-m') and algal cell densities into the trigonometric regression to predict their seasonal variations and the autocorrelation function was applied to calculate the time lag between them. We found that the time lag only existed between F-v/F-m from blue channel and algal cell densities even both F-v/F-m and F-v/F-m 0 show the significant non-linear dynamics relationships with algal cell densities. The peak values of total algal cell density, cyanobacteria density and Microcystis density followed the foregoing peak value of F-v/F-m from blue channel with a time lagged around 40 days. Therefore, we could predict the possibilities of Microcystis bloom and estimate the algal cell densities in Lake Erhai ahead of 40 days based on the trends of F-v/F-m values from blue channel. The results from our study implies that the corresponding critical thresholds between F-v/F-m value and bloom occurrence, which might give new insight into prediction of cyanobacteria blooms and provide a convenient and efficient way for establishment of early warning of cyanobacteria bloom in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems.",,10.3389/fpls.2018.00869,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.00869,Journal

The only drawback to their use is their low and non-selective reactivity compared to the aromatic epoxides. Properly, a small optimized amount of true initiators can overcome this issue and also beneficially serve in properties such as glass transition, modulus, strength, elongation at break, and chemical resistance. This paper presents efforts to understand and identify the initiator's effect to more accurately predict how to select a good initiator on EVO/dicarboxylic acid systems. A new bio-based reprocessable epoxy resin was prepared from epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) and 2,2'-dithiodibenzoic acid (DTBA). The evolution of the chemical structures and the reactions' mechanisms have been systematically studied by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A screening of 10 initiators was performed for the ELO/DTBA cross-linking reaction. The influence of the initiator's structure, basicity, and nucleophilicity was assessed and ranked in terms of the kinetic response including the epoxy-acid reaction rate and the percentage of functional group consumption. An excellent effect achieved by imidazole as an initiator was demonstrated.

A prophecy for 2020 was that machines and robots would replace people. It happened mainly for routine activities. Therefore, humans remain a crucial element in the technology world, especially in high-risk areas, such as nuclear. Companies developing, using high-risk technologies employ people with high-technical knowledge - not enough. Poor communication, failing leadership, improper management, decision reluctance, generation gap, lacking teamwork competencies were human errors that caused accidents. Besides technical competences, these people also need consistent training and workshops on soft skills, leadership, and strategy. Besides generic skills, requirements for training staff in long-life cycle technologies should consider: specific reaction patterns for various generations; the high-risk technologies are a combination of technologies with various durations, e.g., Silicon-based digital technology life cycle is about five years. However, the digital technology evolution to new ones, like quantum computing, may trigger unexpected interfaces with the underlying reactor technology, dominant in a nuclear plant, and requirements for training of staff. Extended use of the well-trained competencies can make the difference between life and death; Training? Because it is a combination of knowledge and practice; Coaching? Because it generates new behaviors in ordinary situations and improves the work-unit relationship; Leadership? Because there are moments when people need someone leading them to accomplish tasks efficiently. The methodology used to investigate such aspects was of team-group interviews for diverse generations involved in a nuclear project for risk analyses and master students, by using the same combination of training and coaching exercises.

(2015),2015,Constructing Multifunctional Virus-Templated Nanoporous Composites for Thin Film Solar Cells: Contributions of Morphology and Optics to Photocurrent Generation,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,"Biotemplates, such as the high aspect ratio M13 bacteriophage, can be used to nucleate noble metal nanoparticles and photoactive materials such as metal oxides, as well as organize them into continuous structures. Such attributes make them attractive scaffolds for solar applications requiring precise organization at the nanoscale. For instance, thin film solar cells benefit from nanostructured morphologies that aid light absorption and carrier transport. Here, we present a biotemplating strategy for assembling nanostructured thin film solar cells that enhance the generated photocurrent through two features: (1) a nanoporous and continuous M13 bacteriophage-templated titania network that improves charge collection and (2) the incorporation of metal nanoparticles within the active layer of the device to improve light harvesting. We demonstrate our ability to construct virus-templated solar cells by applying this strategy to depleted titania lead sulfide quantum dot (PbS QD) bulk heterojunctions. The titania morphology produced by our biotemplate allows charges to be efficiently collected from the bulk of the active material and light that is otherwise poorly absorbed by the QDs to be harvested using metal nanoparticles that exhibit plasmon resonances in the visible range. We show that high aspect ratio bacteriophages provide a structural template for synthesizing titania networks with tunable porosity, into which PbS QDs are infiltrated to create photoactive nanocomposites suitable for photovoltaics. Upon optimization, the generated photocurrent and power conversion efficiency of the bacteriophage-templated devices demonstrate a 2-fold improvement over those of control devices made with randomly organized titania nanoparticles. When the virus is complexed with gold nanopartides (Au NPs), silver nanopartides (Ag NPs), or silver nanoplates (Ag NPLs) during assembly, the device performance is further improved, with Ag NPLs enhancing the short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency by 16% and 36.5%, respectively, over those of virus-based devices without NPs. The observed trends in photocurrent enhancement match well with numerical predictions, and the role of the nanostructured morphology on the device optics was computationally explored. The challenges overcome in this work could be extended to other heterojunction devices, such as hybrid systems involving conducting polymers, as well as other biologically templated electronics.",,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b00295,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b00295,Journal

The transition data are in the 0.7-17 000 cm(-1) region, with a large gap between 7000 and 15 000 cm(-1). The MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) algorithm is used to determine the energy levels. Out of the 29 450 measured transitions 10 041 and 18 947 belong to ortho- and para-(NH3)-N-14, respectively. A careful analysis of the related experimental spectroscopic network (SN) allows 28 530 of the measured transitions to be validated, 18 178 of these are unique, while 462 transitions belong to floating components. Despite the large number of spectroscopic measurements published over the last 80 years, the transitions determine only 30 vibrational band origins of (NH3)-N-14, 8 for ortho- and 22 for para-(NH3)-N-14. The highest J value, where J stands for the rotational quantum number, for which an energy level is validated is 31. The number of experimental-quality ortho- and para-(NH3)-N-14 rovibrational energy levels is 1724 and 3237, respectively. The MARVEL energy levels are checked against ones in the BYTe first-principles database, determined previously.

This paper aims to present a non-myopic scheduling method of multiple radar sensors for tracking the low-altitude maneuvering targets. In this scheduling problem, the best sensors are systematically selected to observe targets for getting the best tracking accuracy under maintaining the low intercepted probability of a multi-sensor system. Design/methodology/approach First, the sensor scheduling process is formulated within the partially observable Markov decision process framework. Second, the interacting multiple model algorithm and the cubature Kalman filter algorithm are combined to estimate the target state, and the DBZ information is applied to estimate the target state when the measurement information is missing. Then, an approximate method based on a cubature sampling strategy is put forward to calculate the future expected objective of the multi-step scheduling process.

Examination of such gases helps monitor various diseases. The ability of nanosensors to potentially detect conditions such as Rhinitis digestive diseases, liver transplant rejection, inflammation in the stomach, cystic fibrosis, encephalopathy, helicobacter pylon digestive cancer, respiratory diseases, and COVID-19, by examining nitric oxide (NO), has been discussed as well as studied increasingly in recent years. In this paper, we have proposed a low-cost detector that can measure NO gas from the exhaled air, which is applied to the ppb level at room temperature. A sensor that detects NO gas with high sensitivity by using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as nanomaterials, has been fabricated. The semiconductor-type gas sensors using SWNTs showed characteristics such as rapid detection, long-term reliability, reproducibility, and miniaturization at room temperature. To improve the selectivity for NO gas, SWNT network channels were formed between the Au electrodes, and SWNTs were functionalized with en-APTAS. A new rinse process was introduced to solve the problem of low sensitivity in SWNT-based NO sensors. With the introduction of the improved rinsing process, the recovery of the fabricated sensor increased from less than 20% to 90.34% when the device was rinsed ten times under optimized conditions. The improved rinsing process effectively straightened the rearrangement of the large amount of amine-functionalized SWNTs attached during the electrostatic self-assembled deposition. In addition, a 28.64% response for a 100 ppb concentration of NO gas was measured at room temperature. We also confirmed that the fabricated sensor does not react with carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) gases owing to its high selectivity to NO gas.",,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149250,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149250,Journal
2383,WOS,Babakhani et al. (2017),2017,Parameterization and prediction of nanoparticle transport in porous media: A reanalysis using artificial neural network,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The continuing rapid expansion of industrial and consumer processes based on nanoparticles (NP) necessitates a robust model for delineating their fate and transport in groundwater. An ability to reliably specify the full parameter set for prediction of NP transport using continuum models is crucial. In this paper we report the reanalysis of a data set of 493 published column experiment outcomes together with their continuum modeling results. Experimental properties were parameterized into 20 factors which are commonly available. They were then used to predict five key continuum model parameters as well as the effluent concentration via artificial neural network (ANN)-based correlations. The Partial Derivatives (PaD) technique and Monte Carlo method were used for the analysis of sensitivities and model-produced uncertainties, respectively. The outcomes shed light on several controversial relationships between the parameters, e.g., it was revealed that the trend of K-att with average pore water velocity was positive. The resulting correlations, despite being developed based on a black-box technique (ANN), were able to explain the effects of theoretical parameters such as critical deposition concentration (CDC), even though these parameters were not explicitly considered in the model. Porous media heterogeneity was considered as a parameter for the first time and showed sensitivities higher than those of dispersivity. The model performance was validated well against subsets of the experimental data and was compared with current models. The robustness of the correlation matrices was not completely satisfactory, since they failed to predict the experimental breakthrough curves (BTCs) at extreme values of ionic strengths. Plain Language Summary Models based on advection-dispersion-equation (ADE), have succeeded in describing a variety of nanoparticle (NP) transport mechanisms within subsurface porous media. These models are usually fitted against known observation data to obtain the unknown parameters. Nevertheless, the parameters determined in this way cannot be used for a new problem of the same type and again there exists the need for the data to calibrate the model parameters for a new problem. Black box models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), have been mostly, if not all the times, used in the same way of ADE models, i.e., single problem solver. In this paper we use the ability of ANN to develop a series of simple correlation matrices that can be easily used for the prediction of ADE parameters in the new problem without the need for additional calibration. Although comparisons between ANN model predictions and experimental data show that there is still further work to be done, our approach out-performs other comparable models and offers new insight into the complex interactions among the factors determining NP transport and fate in the environment.",,10.1002/2016WR020358,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR020358,Journal
2384,WOS,Hadjadj et al. (2019),2019,Renewable energy and raw materials - The thermodynamic support,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"The energy and raw material supplies are crucial issues in our societies. The possible solution of these issues can be coupled with the storage alternatives of renewable energy. The chemical way of energy storage can be quite different but we follow the Supplement of Natural Gas concept since this delivers a high storage capacity solution. The chemical way of energy storage is based on the carbon dioxide hydrogenation. It is in agreement with the theory of the circular economy so that the carbon emission is reduced with the concept of Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU). In this work the reaction system of the carbon dioxide hydrogenation is studied thermodynamically applying the tool of quantum chemistry. The aim of the study is to support the carbon dioxide transformation alternatives of industrial scale, that is, the CCU. It is determined that the methane production has the highest thermodynamic efficiency where the methanol production is the second in the ranking. These thermodynamic efficiencies are 14.4% for methanol and 44.4% for methane. Both alternatives have, however, advantages since the methane can be introduced directly into the natural gas network and the methanol has the highest volumetric energy content. Both molecules can be transformed into different kind of raw materials, see e.g. methanol economy. At the selection, however, other, practical points of view should be also considered where industrial experiences and circumstances are to be also taken into account. Having recognized the need to deal with the reduction and utilization of carbon dioxide emission (CCU), the University of Miskolc established the Environmental Carbon Dioxide Partnership. It has several industrial partners having significant carbon dioxide emission and therefore experience in this issue. The experts of the partnership help to solve emission problems and the carbon dioxide utilization, based on the theoretical and practical results and experiences of the Partnership. This thermodynamic investigation supports the development of the Partnership to carry out the most efficient CCU method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

2385,WOS,Kroes (2021),2021,Computational approaches to dissociative chemisorption on metals: towards chemical accuracy,PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,"We review the state-of-the-art in the theory of dissociative chemisorption (DC) of small gas phase molecules on metal surfaces, which is important to modeling heterogeneous catalysis for practical reasons, and for achieving an understanding of the wealth of experimental information that exists for this topic, for fundamental reasons. We first give a quick overview of the experimental state of the field. Turning to the theory, we address the challenge that barrier heights (E-b, which are not observables) for DC on metals cannot yet be calculated with chemical accuracy, although embedded correlated wave function theory and diffusion Monte-Carlo are moving in this direction. For benchmarking, at present chemically accurate E-b can only be derived from dynamics calculations based on a semi-empirically derived density functional (DF), by computing a sticking curve and demonstrating that it is shifted from the curve measured in a supersonic beam experiment by no more than 1 kcal mol(-1). The approach capable of delivering this accuracy is called the specific reaction parameter (SRP) approach to density functional theory (DFT). SRP-DFT relies on DFT and on dynamics calculations, which are most efficiently performed if a potential energy surface (PES) is available. We therefore present a brief review of the DFs that now exist, also considering their performance on databases for E-b for gas phase reactions and DC on metals, and for adsorption to metals. We also consider expressions for SRP-DFs and briefly discuss other electronic structure methods that have addressed the interaction of molecules with metal surfaces. An overview is presented of dynamical models, which make a distinction as to whether or not, and which dissipative channels are modeled, the dissipative channels being surface phonons and electronically non-adiabatic channels such as electron-hole pair excitation. We also discuss the dynamical methods that have been used, such as the quasi-classical trajectory method and quantum dynamical methods like the time-dependent wave packet method and the reaction path Hamiltonian method. Limits on the accuracy of these methods are discussed for DC of diatomic and polyatomic molecules on metal surfaces, paying particular attention to reduced dimensionality approximations that still have to be invoked in wave packet calculations on polyatomic molecules like CH4. We also address the accuracy of fitting methods, such as recent machine learning methods (like neural network methods) and the corrugation reducing procedure. In discussing the calculation of observables we emphasize the importance of modeling the properties of the supersonic beams in simulating the sticking probability curves measured in the associated experiments. We show that chemically accurate barrier heights have now been extracted for DC in 11 molecule-metal surface systems, some of which form the most accurate core of the only existing database of E-b for DC reactions on metal surfaces (SBH10). The SRP-DFs (or candidate SRP-DFs) that have been derived show transferability in many cases, i.e., they have been shown also to yield chemically accurate E-b for chemically related systems. This can in principle be exploited in simulating rates of catalyzed reactions on nano-particles containing facets and edges, as SRP-DFs may be transferable among systems in which a molecule dissociates on low index and stepped surfaces of the same metal. In many instances SRP-DFs have allowed important conclusions regarding the mechanisms underlying observed experimental trends. An important recent observation is that SRP-DFT based on semi-local exchange DFs has so far only been successful for systems for which the difference of the metal work function and the molecule's electron affinity exceeds 7 eV. A main challenge to SRP-DFT is to extend its applicability to the other systems, which involve a range of important DC reactions of e.g. O-2, H2O, NH3, CO2, and CH3OH. Recent calculations employing a PES based on a screened hybrid exchange functional suggest that the road to success may be based on using exchange functionals of this category.",,10.1039/d1cp00044f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cp00044f,Journal
2386,WOS,Dontu (2018),2018,The strengths of values as potentiators for improving research competence and self-achievement,FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADULT EDUCATION (CIEA 2018): EDUCATION FOR VALUES - CONTINUITY AND CONTEXT,"Through all the times human civilization changed itself due to three big powers: religion, philosophy and science. Nowadays we do not live in a society of knowledge, as it is commonly accepted, but rather in a technocratic one, because other forms of interpretation of the world, as well as spiritual aspects human being have been impaired. Authentic human reasoning is superior to cybernetic data. Furthermore, it brings discernment between critical and creative thinking, it offers fulfillment, grace to contemplative reflection, it obligates to some consistency of persuasion. Through this understanding, we interpret human competence as transferable packet of knowledge, abilities and attitudes. Competitive discoveries in sciences increased comfort in materialistic life. Anyway, there is a lack of the same rate of complementary development of conscious life, for the well-being, because we forgot to explore the higher values of hmankind These are represented by fair scientific inference between the potency of affective rationalization above the intelligible logic. The disruption of linking the revealing by intuition with its relevance by conceptualization, gives rise to gaps in economic, ecological, educational progress. Here's why the policy makers should pay attention to the primary investment in various forms of education, as this is the foundation for every beneficial challenge. In this study we intend to elucidate the nature of interaction between academic performance, owned values, and competences. We consider these variables could serve as indicators of theoretical and methodological reference for self directed education and achievement. Our purpose was justified by the necessity of developing the framework for the research competence, in order to have a better functioning of the educational environment, of the labor market, for individual and social welfare. The methodology included: a)theoretical findings, which offered us some observations of possible dissonances between educational projected inputs and outputs, b)non-experimental, transversal study between the data obtained from the applied questionaries, c) statistical-mathematical analysis of results, based on correlations between 3 variables: the aquired/ transferred competences, stated by teachers, the values and the performances estimated by students as they are facing teaching-learning-evaluating process. The conclusions of the research highlight the importance of synergistic student-teacher's communication as communion, with knowledge exchange, transfer of valuable feelings, correction of failures, appreciation of succeses and awared commitment. We recognize usually academic performance in a mathematical way by comparisation, but reality is digital on specific ways, where in complexity, as human reasoning, it is analogous. The findings suggest that qualitative connotation of value, beside quantitative descriptors, is also a key for more fruitful discoveries of surrounding manifestations under different aspects. We conclude that in a physical world of aproximative probabilities, in a quantum universe of uncertainties, in a vigilant consciousness of own existence and an abundant information society, we have to develop strategies to perceive new nature's disclosures due to transcendence of value's consensus. Or, the prospective for emancipation of personality, since, to grow yourself, you must know yourself, implicates the values- the valences of what is worth like good common sense, because A human being is the measure of all things (Protagoras).",,,,
