2,10.3390/QUANTUM2010014,Manzalini (2020),Quantum Communications in Future Networks and Services,Quantum Reports,2020,"Over the last few years, we have witnessed an impressive growth of data traffic and a progressive Digital Transformation of Industry and Society: the deployment of the ultra-broadband and low latency network infrastructures (e.g., 5G) are leading to a global digitalization of several domains. These techno-economic trends are expected to continue and even accelerate in the next decade, at end of which, 6G and smart networks and services will be exploited. Innovation will continue to drive the global economy into the next decade. This paper draws some technology trends and applications scenarios for this horizon, where Quantum Optical Communications are likely to disrupt Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Telecommunications. Among the enabling technologies and solutions moving in this direction, this paper briefly addresses: quantum optical switching and computing, THz-to-optical conversions and advanced metamaterials for smart radio-optical programmable environments and Artificial Intelligence. The paper concludes with the description of a future application scenario, called Quantum Optical Twin, where the above Quantum Optical Communications technologies are exploited to provide services such as: ultra-massive scale communications for connected spaces and ambient intelligence, holographic telepresence, tactile Internet, new paradigms of brain computer interactions, innovative forms of communications.",18,48
3,(missing DOI),Chancellor et al. (2020),Toward a standardized methodology for constructing quantum computing use cases,arXiv: Artificial Intelligence,2020,"We propose a standardized methodology for developing and evaluating use cases for quantum computers and quantum inspired methods. This methodology consists of a standardized set of questions which should be asked to determine how and indeed if, near term quantum computing can play a role in a given application. Developing such a set of questions is important because it allows different use cases to be evaluated in a fair and objective way, rather than considering each case on an ad hoc basis which could lead to an evaluation which focuses on positives of a use case, while ignoring weaknesses. To demonstrate our methodology we apply it to a concrete use case, ambulance dispatch, and find that there are some ways in which near term quantum computing could be deployed sensibly, but also demonstrate some cases ways in which its use would not be advised. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a dialogue within the community of quantum computing scientists and potential end users on what questions should be asked when developing real world use cases.",0,24
4,(missing DOI),Sevilla & Riedel (2020),Forecasting timelines of quantum computing,arXiv: Quantum Physics,2020,"We consider how to forecast progress in the domain of quantum computing. For this purpose we collect a dataset of quantum computer systems to date, scored on their physical qubits and gate error rate, and we define an index combining both metrics, the generalized logical qubit. We study the relationship between physical qubits and gate error rate, and tentatively conclude that they are positively correlated (albeit with some room for doubt), indicating a frontier of development that trades-off between them. We also apply a log-linear regression on the metrics to provide a tentative upper bound on how much progress can be expected over time. Within the (generally optimistic) assumptions of our model, including the key assumption that exponential progress in qubit count and gate fidelity will continue, we estimate that that proof-of-concept fault-tolerant computation based onsuperconductor technology is unlikely (<5% confidence) to be exhibited before 2026, and that quantum devices capable of factoring RSA-2048 are unlikely (<5% confidence) to exist before 2039. It is of course possible that these milestones will in fact be reached earlier, but that this would require faster progress than has yet been seen.",6,76

Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks. 5G wireless systems, with improved data rates, capacity, latency, and QoS are expected to be the panacea of most of the current cellular networks’ problems. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution toward 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the radio access network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in-depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms, and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE, and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency.

Such protocols will have numerous advantages over simple quantum annealing. By using such searches the effect of problem mis-specification can be reduced, as only energy differences between the searched states will be relevant. The quantum annealing algorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical technique which has now been superseded. Hence, I explore two strategies to use an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization algorithms. Specifically, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can be used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering which use quantum searches as subroutines. The techniques given here can be applied not only to optimization, but also to sampling. I examine the feasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such protocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the flux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc. I further provide proof-of-principle numerical experiments based on quantum Monte Carlo that demonstrate simple examples of the discussed techniques.",65,55

In the last couple of decades, the world has seen several stunning instances of quantum algorithms that provably outperform the best classical algorithms. For most problems, however, it is currently unknown whether quantum algorithms can provide an advantage, and if so by how much, or how to design quantum algorithms that realize such advantages. Many of the most challenging computational problems arising in the practical world are tackled today by heuristic algorithms that have not been mathematically proven to outperform other approaches but have been shown to be effective empirically. While quantum heuristic algorithms have been proposed, empirical testing becomes possible only as quantum computation hardware is built. The next few years will be exciting as empirical testing of quantum heuristic algorithms becomes more and more feasible.

(2017),From the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to a Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz.,arXiv: Quantum Physics,2017,"The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.",240,106

(2017),Hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver for small molecules and quantum magnets,Nature,2017,"The ground-state energy of small molecules is determined efficiently using six qubits of a superconducting quantum processor. Quantum simulation is currently the most promising application of quantum computers. However, only a few quantum simulations of very small systems have been performed experimentally. Here, researchers from IBM present quantum simulations of larger systems using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (or eigensolver), a previously suggested method for quantum optimization. They perform quantum chemical calculations of LiH and BeH2 and an energy minimization procedure on a four-qubit Heisenberg model. Their application of the variational quantum eigensolver is hardware-efficient, which means that it is optimized on the given architecture. Noise is a big problem in this implementation, but quantum error correction could eventually help this experimental set-up to yield a quantum simulation of chemically interesting systems on a quantum computer. Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance computers1. Finding exact solutions to such problems numerically has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet experimental implementations have so far been restricted to molecules involving only hydrogen and helium2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we demonstrate the experimental optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground-state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepared trial states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians9 and a robust stochastic optimization routine10. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement between our experiments and numerical simulations using a model of the device with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.",1548,49

One major piece of evidence for this proposition has been the fact that Quantum Annealing (QA) finds the minimum of some cost functions exponentially more quickly than classical Simulated Annealing (SA). One such cost function is the simple ""Hamming weight with a spike"" function in which the input is an n-bit string and the objective function is simply the Hamming weight, plus a tall thin barrier centered around Hamming weight n/4. While the global minimum of this cost function can be found by inspection, it is also a plausible toy model of the sort of local minima that arise in real-world optimization problems. It was shown by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann that for this example SA takes exponential time and QA takes polynomial time, and the same result was generalized by Reichardt to include barriers with width and height scaling as positive powers of n such that the total area under the barrier is at most the square root of n. This advantage could be explained in terms of quantum-mechanical ""tunneling."" Our work considers a classical algorithm known as Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) which relates certain quantum systems to classical Markov chains. By proving that these chains mix rapidly, we show that SQA runs in polynomial time on the Hamming weight with spike problem in much of the parameter regime where QA achieves an exponential advantage over SA. While our analysis only covers this toy model, it can be seen as evidence against the prospect of exponential quantum speedup using tunneling. Our technical contributions include extending the canonical path method for analyzing Markov chains to cover the case when not all vertices can be connected by low-congestion paths. We also develop methods for taking advantage of warm starts and for relating the quantum state in QA to the probability distribution in SQA. These techniques may be of use in future studies of SQA or of rapidly mixing Markov chains in general.",86,45
