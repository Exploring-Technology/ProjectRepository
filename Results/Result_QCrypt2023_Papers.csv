Vilasini (ETH ZÃƒÂ¼rich); Ramona Wolf (ETH ZÃƒÂ¼rich)",Security proof of DPS QKD using relativistic principles,"First full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, combining quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity.","The design of quantum protocols for secure key generation poses many challenges: On the one hand, they need to be practical concerning experimental realisations. On the other hand, their theoretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof against all possible attacks. Often, these two requirements are in conflict with each other, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemplifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current optical telecommunication technology, which, for this protocol, comes at the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. After about 20 years since its invention, this work presents the first full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, including finite-size effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protocol. In addition, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are, in fact, stronger than collective attacks.",2023,0.79613781,0.114307053,0.089555152,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.328986895,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.104821026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38328362,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38328362,0,0,0,0.23616603,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.335520493,0.209642052,0,0,0.023638383,0,0,0.38328362,0,0,0,0,0.464991151,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.104821026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2,Experimental Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution Over 1000 km Fiber Distance,Yang Liu (Jinan Institute of Quantum Technology),Twin-Field QKD over long distances,Demonstrated twin-field QKD over 1002 km using 3-intensity sending-or-not-sending protocol with ultra-low noise detectors.,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) aims to generate secure private keys shared by two remote parties. With its security being protected by principles of quantum mechanics, some technology challenges remain towards the practical application of QKD. The major one is the distance limit, which is caused by the fact that a quantum signal cannot be amplified while the channel loss is exponential with the distance for photon transmission in optical fiber. Here using the 3-intensity sending-or-not-sending protocol with the actively-odd-parity-pairing method, we demonstrate a fiber-based twin-field QKD over 1002 km. In our experiment, we developed a dual-band phase estimation and ultra-low noise superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to suppress the system noise to around 0.02 Hz. The secure key rate is $9.53\times10^{-12}$ per pulse through 1002 km fiber in the asymptotic regime, and $8.75\times10^{-12}$ per pulse at 952 km considering the finite size effect.

It requires, however, that the phase of each emitted pulse is uniformly random. This might be difficult to guarantee in practice, due to inevitable device imperfections and/or the use of an external phase modulator for phase randomization, which limits the possible selected phases to a finite set. Here, we investigate the security of decoy-state QKD with arbitrary, continuous or discrete, non-uniform phase randomization, and show that this technique is quite robust to deviations from the ideal uniformly random scenario. For this, we combine a novel parameter estimation technique based on semi-definite programming, with the use of basis mismatched events, to tightly estimate the parameters that determine the achievable secret key rate. In doing so, we demonstrate that our analysis can significantly outperform previous results that address more restricted scenarios.",2023,0.102130398,0.79839164,0.099477984,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45477389,0,0,0.195174855,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06218615,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.42032377,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.124372301,0,0,0.004674571,0,0.682160834,0,0,0,0,0,0.275860777,0,0,0,0,0.117253082,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06218615,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Weak coin flipping (WCF) is a significant such primitive which allows two mistrustful parties to agree on a random bit while they favor opposite outcomes. Remarkably, perfect information-theoretic security can be achieved in principle for quantum WCF, which is impossible for a classical coin flip without computational assumptions or trusting a third party. In this work, we overcome conceptual and practical issues that have prevented the experimental demonstration of this primitive to date, and demonstrate how quantum resources can provide cheat sensitivity, whereby each party can detect a cheating opponent, and an honest party is never sanctioned. Such a property is not known to be classically achievable with information-theoretic security.

Emerging progress in quantum technologies involving such links needs to be accompanied by appropriate certification tools. In adversarial scenarios, a certification method can be vulnerable to attacks if too much trust is placed on the underlying system. Here, we propose a protocol in a device independent framework, which allows for the certification of practical quantum transmission links in scenarios where minimal assumptions are made about the functioning of the certification setup. We take in particular unavoidable transmission losses into account by modeling the link as a completely-positive trace-decreasing map. We also crucially remove the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples, which is known to be incompatible with adversarial settings. Finally, in view of the use of the certified transmitted states for follow-up applications, our protocol allows to estimate the quality of the state and does not certify the channel only.

9,Entropy Accumulation under Post-Quantum Cryptographic Assumptions,"Ilya Merkulov, Rotem Arnon-Friedman",Post-Quantum Cryptography,"Device-independent protocols, computational assumption, entropic uncertainty relation, entropy accumulation theorem, flexible proof technique","In device-independent (DI) quantum protocols, the security statements are oblivious to the characterization of the quantum apparatusÃ¢â‚¬â€œ they are based solely on the classical interaction with the devices as well as some well-defined assumptions. The most commonly known setup is the so-called non-local one, in which two devices that cannot communicate with each other present a violation of a Bell inequality. In recent years, a new variant of DI protocols, requiring only a single device, arose. In this novel research avenue, the no-communication assumption is replaced with a computational assumption which states that the device cannot solve certain post-quantum cryptographic tasks. The protocols in literature that have been analyzed in this setting, e.g., randomness certification, used ad hoc proof techniques. In addition, the strength of the achieved results is hard to judge due to their complexity. Here, we build on ideas coming from the study of non-local DI protocols and develop a new modular proof technique for the single-device computational setting. We present a flexible framework for proving the security of such protocols by utilizing a combination of tools from quantum information theory, such as the entropic uncertainty relation and the entropy accumulation theorem. This leads to an insightful and simple proof of security as well as to explicit quantitative bounds.

However, given the difficulty of fabricating polarized independent components on the chip, previous studies have only adopted off-chip devices to demodulate the quantum states or perform polarization compensation. In the current work, a fully chip-based decoder for polarization-encoding QKD was proposed. The chip realized a polarization state analyzer and compensated for the BB84 protocol without the requirement of additional hardware, which was based on a polarization-to-path conversion method utilizing a polarization splitter-rotator. The chip was fabricated adopting a standard silicon photonics foundry, which was of a compact design and suitable for mass production. In the experimental stability test, an average quantum bit error rate of 0.59% was achieved through continuous operation for 10 h without any polarization feedback. Furthermore, the chip enabled the automatic compensation of the fiber polarization drift when utilizing the developed feedback algorithm, which was emulated by a random fiber polarization scrambler.

Unfortunately, the key rate of passive DV-QKD protocols suffers from sifting loss and additional quantum errors. In this work, we propose the general framework of passive continuous variable quantum key distribution. Rather surprisingly, we find that the passive source is a perfect candidate for the discrete-modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution (DMCV QKD) protocol. With the phase space remapping scheme, we show that passive DMCV QKD offers the same key rate as its active counterpart.

We introduce inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ), and construct it from classical bit commitments. IV-PoQ is an interactive protocol between a verifier and a quantum prover consisting of two phases. In the first phase, the verifier is probabilistic polynomial-time, and it interacts with the prover. In the second phase, the verifier becomes inefficient, and makes its decision based on the transcript of the first phase. If the prover is honest, the inefficient verifier accepts with high probability, but any classical malicious prover only has a small probability of being accepted by the inefficient verifier. Our construction demonstrates the following results: (1)If one-way functions exist, then IV-PoQ exist. (2)If distributional collision-resistant hash functions exist (which exist if hard-on-average problems in SZK exist), then constant-round IV-PoQ exist. We also demonstrate quantum advantage based on worst-case-hard assumptions. We define auxiliary-input IV-PoQ (AI-IV-PoQ) that only require that for any malicious prover, there exist infinitely many auxiliary inputs under which the prover cannot cheat. We construct AI-IV-PoQ from an auxiliary-input version of commitments in a similar way, showing that (1)If auxiliary-input one-way functions exist (which exist if CZKÃ¢Å Ë†BPP), then AI-IV-PoQ exist.

Kahanamoku-Meyer (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory & UC Berkeley); Eitan Porat (Weizmann Institute of Science); Thomas Vidick (Weizmann Institute of Science),Quantum Certifiability,Tests of quantumness certify qubits; protocols based on post-quantum functions.,"A test of quantumness is a protocol that allows a classical verifier to certify (only) that a prover is not classical. We show that tests of quantumness that follow a certain template, which captures recent proposals such as (Kalai et al., 2022), can in fact do much more. Namely, the same protocols can be used for certifying a qubit, a building-block that stands at the heart of applications such as certifiable randomness and classical delegation of quantum computation. Certifying qubits was previously only known to be possible based on the hardness of the Learning with Errors problem and the use of adaptive hardcore (Brakerski et al., 2018). Our framework allows certification of qubits based only on the existence of post-quantum trapdoor claw-free functions, or on quantum fully homomorphic encryption. These can be instantiated, for example, from Ring Learning with Errors. On the technical side, we show that the quantum soundness of any such protocol can be reduced to proving a bound on a simple algorithmic task: informally, answering 'two challenges simultaneously' in the protocol. Our reduction formalizes the intuition that these protocols demonstrate quantumness by leveraging the impossibility of rewinding a general quantum prover. This allows us to prove tight bounds on the quantum soundness of (Kahanamoku-Meyer et al., 2021) and (Kalai et al., 2022), showing that no quantum polynomial-time prover can succeed with probability larger than cos^2(Ãâ‚¬/8)Ã¢â€°Ë†0.853. Previously, only an upper bound on the success probability of classical provers, and a lower bound on the success probability of quantum provers, were known. We then extend this proof of quantum soundness to show that provers that approach the quantum soundness bound must perform almost anti-commuting measurements.

In sharp contrast, the picture of concurrently secure MPC (or even 2PC), for both classical and quantum functionalities, still remains unclear. Quantum information behaves in a fundamentally different way, making the job of adversary harder and easier at the same time. Thus, it is unclear if the positive or negative results from the classical setting still apply. This work initiates a systematic study of concurrent secure computation in the quantum setting. We obtain a mix of positive and negative results. We first show that assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions (PQ-OWFs), concurrently secure 2PC (and thus MPC) for quantum functionalities is impossible. Next, we focus on the bounded-concurrent setting, where we obtain simulation-sound zero-knowledge arguments for both NP and QMA, assuming PQ-OWFs. This is obtained by a new design of simulation-sound gadget which is compatible with the quantum rewinding strategy recently developed by Ananth, Chung, and La Placa [CRYPTO'21] for bounded-concurrent post-quantum ZK. Moreover, we show that our technique is general enough---It also leads to quantum-secure bounded-concurrent coin-flipping protocols, and eventually general-purpose 2PC and MPC, for both classical and quantum functionalities.

The most general such resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at the outset of each protocol execution. We call this the Common Reference Quantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference String (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but appears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes exhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a maximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We formalize this notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the mÃ¢â‚¬â€œbit output to have some randomness when conditioned on the nÃ¢â‚¬â€œbit input. We show that when n Ã¢Ë†â€™ m Ã¢Ë†Ë† Ãâ€°(lg n), any protocol for WOTRO in the CRQS model can be attacked by an (inefficient) adversary. Moreover, our adversary is efficiently simulatable, which rules out the possibility of proving the computational security of a scheme by a fully black-box reduction to a cryptographic game assumption. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game quantum assumption for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQ$ model (where the CRQS consists only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically secure WOTRO protocol where m = n, then hash the output. The impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the fully-black-box impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the impossibility result of Bitansky et al. (TCC Ã¢â‚¬â„¢13) to the CRQS model. Second, we show a fully-black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened version of quantum lightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt Ã¢â‚¬â„¢19) where quantum bolts have an additional parameter that cannot be changed without generating new bolts.

Given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, our obfuscator outputs a quantum state $\ket{\widetilde{Q}}$ that can be used to evaluate $Q$ repeatedly on arbitrary inputs. Instantiating the VBB obfuscator for classical circuits with any candidate post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator gives us the first candidate construction of indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. In particular, our scheme is the first candidate obfuscator for a class of circuits that is powerful enough to implement Shor's algorithm (SICOMP 1997). Our approach follows Bartusek and Malavolta (ITCS 2022), who obfuscate \emph{null} quantum circuits by obfuscating the verifier of an appropriate classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) scheme. We go beyond null circuits by constructing a publicly-verifiable CVQC scheme for quantum \emph{partitioning} circuits, which can be used to verify the evaluation procedure of Mahadev's quantum fully-homomorphic encryption scheme (FOCS 2018). We achieve this by upgrading the one-time secure scheme of Bartusek (TCC 2021) to a fully reusable scheme, via a publicly-decodable \emph{Pauli functional commitment}, which we formally define and construct in this work.

Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a quantum server in a \emph{single} round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted, \emph{off-the-shelf (OTS)} quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a single constant-sized measurement from a predetermined logarithmic-sized input. In the OTS model, we thus picture that a single quantum server does the bulk of the computations, while the OTS device is used as an untrusted and generic verification device, all in a single round. We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS model. Scaling up the technique also yields an interactive proof system for all of QMA, which, furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical zero-knowledge. This yields the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover zero-knowledge proof system for QMA. As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for $n$-EPR pairs using only constant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification.

We show that target-collapsing hashes enable publicly-verifiable deletion ($\PVD$), proving conjectures from [Poremba, ITCS'23] and demonstrating that the Dual-Regev encryption (and corresponding fully homomorphic encryption) schemes support $\PVD$ under the LWE assumption.

The most general such resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at the outset of each protocol execution. We call this the Common Reference Quantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference String (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but appears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes exhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a maximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We formalize this notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the mÃ¢â‚¬â€œbit output to have some randomness when conditioned on the nÃ¢â‚¬â€œbit input. We show that when n Ã¢Ë†â€™ m Ã¢Ë†Ë† Ãâ€°(lg n), any protocol for WOTRO in the CRQS model can be attacked by an (inefficient) adversary. Moreover, our adversary is efficiently simulatable, which rules out the possibility of proving the computational security of a scheme by a fully black-box reduction to a cryptographic game assumption. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game quantum assumption for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQ$ model (where the CRQS consists only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically secure WOTRO protocol where m = n, then hash the output. The impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the fully-black-box impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the impossibility result of Bitansky et al. (TCC Ã¢â‚¬â„¢13) to the CRQS model. Second, we show a fully-black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened version of quantum lightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt Ã¢â‚¬â„¢19) where quantum bolts have an additional parameter that cannot be changed without generating new bolts.

Given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, our obfuscator outputs a quantum state $\ket{\widetilde{Q}}$ that can be used to evaluate $Q$ repeatedly on arbitrary inputs. Instantiating the VBB obfuscator for classical circuits with any candidate post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator gives us the first candidate construction of indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. In particular, our scheme is the first candidate obfuscator for a class of circuits that is powerful enough to implement Shor's algorithm (SICOMP 1997). Our approach follows Bartusek and Malavolta (ITCS 2022), who obfuscate \emph{null} quantum circuits by obfuscating the verifier of an appropriate classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) scheme. We go beyond null circuits by constructing a publicly-verifiable CVQC scheme for quantum \emph{partitioning} circuits, which can be used to verify the evaluation procedure of Mahadev's quantum fully-homomorphic encryption scheme (FOCS 2018). We achieve this by upgrading the one-time secure scheme of Bartusek (TCC 2021) to a fully reusable scheme, via a publicly-decodable \emph{Pauli functional commitment}, which we formally define and construct in this work. This commitment scheme, which satisfies a notion of binding against committers that can access the receiver's standard and Hadamard basis decoding functionalities, is constructed by building on techniques of Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC 2020) introduced in the context of equivocal but collision-resistant hash functions.",2024,0.098801553,0.097739913,0.803458512,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.496033091,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.165344364,0.330688727,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.125302457,0.165344364,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.661377454,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.330688727,0.01019734,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.165344364,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a quantum server in a \emph{single} round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted, \emph{off-the-shelf (OTS)} quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a single constant-sized measurement from a predetermined logarithmic-sized input. In the OTS model, we thus picture that a single quantum server does the bulk of the computations, while the OTS device is used as an untrusted and generic verification device, all in a single round. We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS model. Scaling up the technique also yields an interactive proof system for all of QMA, which, furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical zero-knowledge. This yields the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover zero-knowledge proof system for QMA. As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for $n$-EPR pairs using only constant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification.

We introduce the notion of quantum pseudorandom states with proofs of destruction (PRSPD) that combines both these properties. Like standard pseudorandom states (PRS), these are efficiently generated quantum states that are indistinguishable from random, but they can also be measured to create a classical string. This string is verifiable (given the secret key) and certifies that the state has been destructed. We show that, similarly to PRS, PRSPD can be constructed from any post-quantum one-way function. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first construction of a family of states that satisfies both pseudorandomness and provability of destruction.

For instance, Eve can only receive an attenuated version of the transmitted signals. This results in settings where an uncharacterized bypass channel, inaccessible to Eve, can also carry signals to Bob. We obtain generic bounds on the key rate in the presence of bypass channels and apply them to continuous-variable QKD protocols with Gaussian encoding as well as to the family of BB84 protocols.

While QKD systems are becoming commercially available, large-scale deployment of next-generation QKD systems requires photonic and electronic devices that are low-cost, small, and easily integrated with existing network infrastructure. Continuous variable (CV) QKD is a promising option for large-scale deployment due to its compatibility with standard telecom technology. Despite this, the secret key rates of CV-QKD systems have been limited to a few megabits per second due to the bandwidth bottleneck of the receiver and the limited symbol rate of the transmitter.

Furthermore, we will explain how such device has been integrated in a QKD set-up and enabled high-speed QKD, with secret-key rates exceeding 60 Mbps over a distance of 10 km. Moreover when used in a QKD setup, the array can improve resilience against blinding attacks by monitoring the coincidence clicks between the pixels. Finally we will show that the detector is able to distinguish few-photon number states in an optical pulse with high fidelity, without posing strict limitations on the shape of the incoming light. We achieve a 2-photon fidelity of 74% and 57% for a 3-photon state, which represent state-of-the-art results for fibre-coupled SNSPDs. Such detectors could find immediate application in LOQC protocols where the capability to distinguish few photon-number states is sufficient Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that is, either Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ vs Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmore than 1 photonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.",2024,0.842767775,0.083956704,0.073275492,1,0,0,0.196820598,0,0,0,0.222924958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.222924958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.259716986,0,0.222924958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.176572484,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.259716986,0,0,0,0,0,0.259716986,0.529717452,0,0,0,0,0,0.071027823,0,0,0.005339205,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.196820598,0.259716986,0.13392421,0,0.222924958,0,0,0.259716986,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.227352192,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We provide a security proof that is both and provides tight finite-size correction terms. In particular, when expanded in the block length $n$, the rate of randomness generation has the optimal asymptotic rate and optimal leading-order finite-size correction term.
