1,All graph state verification protocols are composably secure,Composable security of graph state verification protocols,Graph state verification protocols can be made composably secure; disproved previous conjectures about composability in abstract cryptography. Introduced a protocol generalizing entanglement swapping for arbitrary graph states.,"Graph state verification protocols allow multiple parties to share a graph state while checking that the state is honestly prepared, even in the presence of malicious parties. Since graph states are the starting point of numerous quantum protocols, it is crucial to ensure that graph state verification protocols can safely be composed with other protocols, this property being known as composable security. Previous works conjectured that such a property could not be proven within the abstract cryptography framework: we disprove this conjecture by showing that all graph state verification protocols can be turned into a composably secure protocol with respect to the natural functionality for graph state preparation. Moreover, we show that any unchanged graph state verification protocol can also be considered as composably secure for a slightly different, yet useful, functionality. Finally, we show that these two results are optimal, in the sense that any such generic result, considering arbitrary black-box protocols, must either modify the protocol or consider a different functionality. Along the way, we show a protocol to generalize entanglement swapping to arbitrary graph states that might be of independent interest.","Léo Colisson (CWI/QuSoft, Amsterdam); Damian Markham (CNRS); Raja Yehia (ICFO)",2024,0.810838,0.0972893,0.0918728,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.102535,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.180974,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.180974,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.155587,0.155587,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.347198,0,0,0.140936,0.347198,0,0,0.412722,0,0,0,0,0.155587,0,0,0,0.622346,0.180974,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.999999994
2,A fast and robust quantum random number generator with a self-contained integrated photonic randomness core,Quantum random number generation (QRNG) using integrated photonic circuits,Presented a fast and scalable QRNG integrated with a photonic circuit for industrial deployment. Demonstrated robustness and stability over long periods of operation. Implemented a security model with secure generation at 2 Gbit/s.,"Random numbers play a crucial role in information technology, particularly as digital communication capacity continues to expand. Consequently, the need for secure and high-rate random number generation has become increasingly urgent. While integrated photonics technology holds promise for mass-producing optoelectronic quantum random number generators (QRNGs), there remains a challenge in developing fast, robust, and scalable solutions suitable for industrial deployment. Addressing this challenge, we present a fast QRNG solution in this study, leveraging a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) directly embedded onto a versatile electronic platform. Designed to withstand real-world applications, our PIC is packaged to align with industrial electronic assembly lines. To rigorously assess scalability and stability, these generators underwent week-long periods of continuous GHz operation. Furthermore, a QRNG was integrated into a quantum key distribution system, where despite operating in an uncontrolled environment, minimal variations in physical randomness were observed over 38 days, as measured from 2.9 million histograms. Finally, we implemented a security model for the QRNGs, enabling rate adjustment to match the actual randomness content and demonstrating secure generation at 2 Gbit/s.","Davide G.

3,Conditional disclosure of secrets with quantum resources,Study of Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) with quantum resources,"Defined the quantum analogue of CDS, called CDQS. Studied the relationship between privacy and quantum resources. Established closure under negation and amplification properties. Provided lower bounds on CDQS using communication complexity techniques.","The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. Following the classical literature on CDS for guidance, we establish closure under negation, an amplification property, and prove a number of lower bounds on CDQS based on communication complexity.","Alex May (Institute for Quantum Computing and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo); Vahid Reza Asadi (University of Waterloo); Kohdai Kuroiwa (Institute for Quantum Computing and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo); Debbie Leung (Institute for Quantum Computing and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo); Sabrina Pasterski (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo); Chris Waddell (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo)",2024,0.0975417,0.0937905,0.808668,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.176263,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.143737,0,0.199342,0,0,0,0,0.176263,0.131371,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.231868,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.231868,0,0,0.231868,0,0,0,0.695605,0,0,0,0,0.463737,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.999999909
4,Lower bounds on entanglement and quantum gates in non-local quantum computation,Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) and resource lower bounds,Presented lower bounds on entanglement and quantum gates in NLQC settings (f-routing and f-BB84). Established linear lower bounds on entanglement for specific functions and a new lower bound on quantum gates in verification schemes.,"A non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces an interaction between two quantum systems with a single simultaneous round of communication and shared entanglement. We study two classes of NLQC, f-routing and f-BB84. These are well studied in the context of position-verification, where they are leading candidates for feasible and secure verification schemes. Both settings require an honest prover implement only O(1) quantum operations. We prove that a dishonest prover must use linear quantum resources to attack the same scheme. First, we give the first non-trivial lower bounds on entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols with perfect correctness. Our bound can be stated in terms of the quantum non-deterministic communication complexity of f. For the equality, non-equality, and greater-than functions we obtain linear lower bounds on entanglement for f-routing and f-BB84 in the perfect setting. In a second result, which applies in the robust setting, we give a new lower bound on the number of quantum gates and measurements needed to attack these verification schemes. We lower bound the gates plus measurements linearly in the simultaneous message passing cost of the function f. This leads to a linear bound against the inner product function. This gives a clear separation between the difficulty of implementing these tasks in the honest and dishonest settings, and does so in a noise robust and loss tolerant setting.",Alex May (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics); Vahid Reza Asadi (University of Waterloo); Eric Culf (University of Waterloo); Richard Cleve (University of Waterloo),2024,0.0949692,0.0951607,0.80987,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103305,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.135894,0,0,0.103305,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38497,0,0,0.271788,0,0,0,0,0,0.350492,0,0.116831,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103305,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.135894,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.135894,0.271788,0.679471,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.135894,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.999999393
5,Making Existing Quantum Position Verification Protocols Secure Against Arbitrary Transmission Loss,Secure quantum position verification (QPV) protocols against transmission loss,"Modified existing QPV protocols to become loss-tolerant by reducing the overall loss rate to the prover's lab. Introduced photon presence detection and a small time delay for secure transmission. The adapted protocol allows secure QPV over long distances, addressing major practical issues and providing strong security guarantees.","Signal loss poses a significant threat to the security of quantum cryptography when the chosen protocol lacks loss-tolerance. In quantum position verification (QPV) protocols, even relatively small loss rates can compromise security. The goal is thus to find protocols that remain secure under practically achievable loss rates. In this work, we modify the usual structure of QPV protocols and prove that this modification makes the potentially high transmission loss between the verifiers and the prover security-irrelevant for a class of protocols that includes a practically-interesting candidate protocol inspired by the BB84 protocol. This modification, which involves photon presence detection, a small time delay at the prover, and a commitment to play before proceeding, reduces the overall loss rate to just the prover’s laboratory. The adapted protocol then becomes a practically feasible QPV protocol with strong security guarantees, even against attackers using adaptive strategies. As the loss rate between the verifiers and prover is mainly dictated by the distance between them, secure QPV over longer distances becomes possible. We also show possible implementations of the required photon presence detection, making the adapted protocol a protocol that solves all major practical issues in QPV. Finally, we discuss experimental aspects and give parameter estimations.","Rene Allerstorfer (QuSoft (CWI Amsterdam)); Andreas Bluhm (Univ.

While a stand-alone secure weak coin flipping protocol can be constructed from noiseless communication channels, its composability has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that no weak coin flipping protocol can be abstracted into a black box resource with composable security.

7,Hacking twin-field quantum key distribution via wavelength-switching attack,Twin-Field QKD Security,Wavelength-switching attack on TF-class QKD. Identified vulnerabilities in the OPLL scheme. Demonstrated increase in mean photon number compromising security.,"The twin-field class quantum key distribution (TF-class QKD) has experimentally demonstrated the ability to surpass the fundamental rate-distance limit without requiring a quantum repeater, as a revolutional milestone. In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Through this study, we disclose security vulnerabilities associated with TF-class QKD implementation and provide valuable insights into its practical security.",Peng Qingqian (National University of Defense Technology); Chen Jiupeng (Jinan Institute of Quantum Technology); Xing Tianyi (National University of Defense Technology); Wang Dongyang (National University of Defense Technology); Wang Yizhi (National University of Defense Technology); Ying Guo (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Liu Yang (Jinan Institute of Quantum Technology); Huang Anqi (National University of Defense Technology),2024,0.0895753,0.827109,0.0833153,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.108415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.185968,0,0,0,0,0.185968,0,0,0,0.334163,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.138603,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.138603,0,0.159874,0,0,0,0.127008,0,0,0,0,0.108415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.420633,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.489269,0.244634,0,0.489269,0,0.999999632
8,Security Proof for Variable-Length Quantum Key Distribution,Variable-Length QKD Security,Security proof against IID collective attacks. Conversion of fixed-length proofs to variable-length protocols. Improved key rates and fixed privacy amplification flaws.,"We present a security proof for variable-length QKD against IID collective attacks. Our proof can be lifted to coherent attacks using the postselection technique. Our first main result is a theorem to convert a sequence of security proofs for fixed-length protocols satisfying certain conditions to a security proof for a variable-length protocol. This conversion requires no new calculations, does not require any changes to the final key lengths or the amount of error-correction information, and at most doubles the security parameter. Our second main result is the description and security proof of a more general class of variable-length QKD protocols, which does not require characterizing the honest behaviour of the channel connecting the users before the execution of the QKD protocol. Instead, these protocols adaptively determine the length of the final key, and the amount of information to be used for error-correction, based upon the observations made during the protocol. We apply these results to the qubit BB84 protocol, and show that variable-length implementations lead to higher expected key rates than the fixed-length implementations. Finally, we point out a critical flaw in the analysis of privacy amplification that arises due to sifting. We provide an elegant solution that retroactively fixes this flaw.",Devashish Tupkary (Institute for Quantum Computing); Ernest Y.-Z.

Solves detector side channels issue. Applicable to practical QKD scenarios.,"Security proofs for quantum key distribution (QKD) based on the entropic uncertainty relations and the phase-error approach have the advantage of producing some of the tightest key rates against coherent attacks. We prove the security of QKD using the entropic uncertainty relations, for scenarios where Eve is allowed full control of the detection efficiency and dark rates of all detectors within some specified ranges. Thus, our work solves the practically important problem of detector side channels. Our work also removes the requirement of ``basis-independent loss'' required by these proof techniques.

Tighter bounds than previous methods. Numerical demonstrations in quantum information processing tasks.,"We developed new concentration inequalities for a quantum state on an N -qudit system or measurement outcomes on it that apply to an adversarial setup, where an adversary prepares the quantum state. Our one-sided concentration inequalities for a quantum state require the N -qudit system to be permutation invariant and are thus de-Finetti type, but they are tighter than the one previously obtained. We show that the bound can further be tightened if each qudit system has an additional symmetry. Furthermore, our concentration inequality for the outcomes of independent and identical measurements on an N -qudit quantum system has no assumption on the adversarial quantum state and is much tighter than the conventional one obtained through Azuma’s inequality.

11,Decoy state quantum key distribution for practical single-photon sources,SPS-Based QKD with Decoy States,Generalized decoy state techniques for SPS. Finite-key security bounds. Key rate enhancement and loss tolerance improvements over DS WCPs.,"High brightness, low second-order correlation function single-photon sources (SPSs) are an alternative to commonly employed weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources for discrete variable quantum key distribution (QKD) and offer potential key-rate and finite-block scaling advantages. However, the loss tolerance of SPS-based QKD is compromised by photon number splitting (PNS) attacks against non-negligible multiphoton emissions. Decoy state (DS) techniques mitigate against PNS attacks, with WCP-DS QKD over several hundred km in fibre being demonstrated. DS QKD protocols for different source photon number statistics have been proposed, such as for binomial and thermal distributions. Here, we investigate the use of generalised DS techniques assuming we do not have access to the true photon number statistics of the SPS. Thus, we bound the source distribution using the mean photon number and the second-order correlation function, which provides us with enough partial knowledge to compute our decoy SPS protocols. Hence, we provide finite-key security bounds for an SPS-based Efficient BB84 for several decoy protocols with optimised parameters, and derive required SPS characteristics to achieve a key rate enhancement over DS WCPs and match their loss tolerance.",Roberto Pousa (University of Strathclyde); Daniel Oi (University of Strathclyde); John Jeffers (University of Strathclyde),2024,0.829489,0.0845269,0.0859846,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.248326,0,0,0,0,0.248326,0,0,0,0.197277,0,0.163652,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.163652,0,0,0.248326,0,0,0,0,0.288845,0,0,0.163652,0,0.0943834,0,0,0.150308,0.0749807,0.415612,0,0.219576,0,0.384025,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.248326,0,0,0.248326,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.288845,0,0,1.000000503
12,Implementation of mode-pairing quantum key distribution in inter-city networks,Mode-Pairing QKD Implementation,Field tests of mode-pairing protocol over inter-city distances. Achieved key rates comparable to single quantum links. Demonstrates adaptability and efficiency.,"Quantum key distribution is a cornerstone of quantum technology, offering information-theoretical secure keys for remote parties. With many quantum communication networks established globally, the mode-pairing protocol stands out for its efficacy over inter-city distances using simple setups, emerging as a promising solution. In this study, we employ the mode-pairing scheme into existing inter-city fiber links, conducting field tests across distances ranging from tens to about a hundred kilometers. Our system achieves a key rate of $1.217$ kbit/s in a $195.85$ km symmetric link and $3.089$ kbit/s in a $127.92$ km asymmetric link without global phase locking. The results demonstrate that the mode-pairing protocol can achieve key rates comparable to those of a single quantum link between two trusted nodes on the Beijing-Shanghai backbone line, effectively reducing the need for half of the trusted nodes. These field tests confirm the mode-pairing scheme's adaptability, efficiency, and practicality, positioning it as a highly suitable protocol for quantum networks.","Yizhi Huang (Center for Quantum Information, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University); Hao-Tao Zhu (Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei); Wen-Xin Pan (Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei); Chao-Wu Zhou (Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei); Mi Zou (Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China); Shibiao Tang (QuantumCTek Corporation Limited, Hefei); Xiongfeng Ma (Center for Quantum Information, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University); Teng-Yun Chen (Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei); and Jian-Wei Pan (Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei)",2024,0.081824,0.835365,0.0828112,2,0.221842,0,0,0,0,0.143948,0,0,0,0,0.493837,0,0,0,0,0.246918,0.246918,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18403,0.246918,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.106136,0.155788,0,0.169024,0,0,0,0.246918,0,0.287896,0,0.279247,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.324812,0.279247,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.999999749
13,Security of hybrid BB84 with heterodyne detection,Hybrid QKD Protocol Security,Security proof for hybrid BB84 protocol. Exploits symmetry to handle continuous-variable challenges. Applied theory to various attack scenarios.,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises everlasting security based on the laws of physics. Most common protocols are grouped into two distinct categories based on the degrees of freedom used to carry information, which can be either discrete or continuous, each presenting unique advantages in either performance, feasibility for near-term implementation, and compatibility with existing telecommunications architectures. Recently, hybrid QKD protocols have been introduced to leverage advantages from both categories. In this work we provide a rigorous security proof for a protocol introduced by Qi in 2021, where information is encoded in discrete variables as in the widespread Bennett Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol but decoded continuously via heterodyne detection. Security proofs for hybrid protocols inherit the same challenges associated with continuous-variable protocols due to unbounded dimensions. Here we successfully address these challenges by exploiting symmetry. Our approach enables truncation of the Hilbert space with precise control of the approximation errors and lead to a tight, semi-analytical expression for the asymptotic key rate under collective attacks. As concrete examples, we apply our theory to compute the key rates under passive attacks, linear loss, and Gaussian noise.",Jasminder Sidhu (University of Strathclyde); Rocco Maggi (Politecnico di Bari); Saverio Pascazio (Universita di Bari); Cosmo Lupo (Politecnico di Bari),2024,0.100113,0.805333,0.0945531,2,0,0.247142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.222043,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.222043,0.106232,0.311859,0,0,0.253181,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.650214,0,0,0,0.2795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.325107,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.247142,0.999999737
14,High-speed Heterodyne-based Quantum Random Number Generator on a Chip,High-Speed QRNG Technology,High-performance QRNG using integrated silicon photonics. Achieves over 20 Gbps rate. Reduces spatial footprint and simplifies implementation.,"A wide range of applications require, by hypothesis, to have access to a private and genuine random source. Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) are currently the sole technology capable of producing true randomness. Nevertheless, other factors must be considered when addressing real-world use cases, and the bulkiness of current implementations significantly limits their adoption. In this work, we present a high-performance source-device independent QRNG leveraging a custom-made integrated silicon photonic chip. The proposed scheme exploits the properties of a heterodyne receiver to enhance security and integration to promote spatial footprint reduction while simplifying its implementation. Such characteristics could represent a significant advancement toward the development of generators better suited to meet the demands of portable and space applications.

We show, perhaps surprisingly, that such an oracle is sufficient to construct quantum pseudorandomness. Pseudorandom states (PRS) are a family of states for which it is hard to distinguish between polynomially many copies of either a state sampled uniformly from the family or a Haar random state. A weaker notion, called single-copy pseudorandom states (1PRS), satisfies this property with respect to a single copy. Our main result is that 1PRS (as well as bit-commitments) exist relative to an oracle that provides a single Haar random state. We build on this result to show the existence of an oracle relative to which 1PRS exist, but PRS do not. This provides one of the first black-box separations between different forms of quantum pseudorandomness.",Boyang Chen (Tsinghua University); Andrea Coladangelo (University of Washington); Or Sattath (Ben Gurion University of the Negev),2024,0.112917,0.115011,0.772072,3,0,0,0,0,0.17305,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.143554,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.385222,0,0,0.243048,0,0.385222,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.770443,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.000000389
18,On Pseudorandomness in the Common Haar State Model,Quantum Pseudorandomness in Common Haar State Model,#NAME?,"Common random string model is a popular model in classical cryptography with many constructions proposed in this model. We study a quantum analogue of this model called the common Haar state model, which was also studied in an independent work by Chen, Coladangelo and Sattath (arXiv 2024). In this model, every party in the cryptographic system receives many copies of one or more i.i.d Haar states. Our main result is the construction of a statistically secure pseudorandom function-like state generator (PRFSG) in the common Haar state model. Our construction satisfies stretch property (output length > $\lambda$), can handle inputs of length $\lambda^{c}$ and is secure as long as the adversary gets $O\left(\frac{\lambda^{1-c}}{(\log(\lambda))^{1.01}} \right)$ number of queries, where $\lambda$ is the length of the PRFSG key and $c \in [0,1)$. We show the optimality of our construction by proving a matching lower bound. As a consequence, for the first time, we show that (computationally secure) PRFSGs for super-logarithmic input length can be constructed from (computationally secure) pseudorandom state generators in some parameter regimes.","Prabhanjan Ananth (University of California, Santa Barbara); Aditya Gulati (University of California, Santa Barbara); Yao-Ting Lin (University of California, Santa Barbara)",2024,0.109942,0.103977,0.786081,3,0,0,0,0,0.19211,0,0,0,0,0.19211,0,0,0,0,0.213825,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.241821,0,0,0,0,0.427651,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0730168,0.404726,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.241821,0,0,0.641476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.999999926

Different technologies have been used in different links to address the variety of situations and needs that arise in real networks, exploring a wide range of possibilities.

22,Quantum Key Leasing for PKE and FHE with a Classical Lessor,Quantum Key Leasing,#NAME?,"In this work, we consider the problem of secure key leasing, also known as revocable cryptography (Agarwal et. al. Eurocrypt' 23, Ananth et. al. TCC' 23), as a strengthened security notion to its predecessor put forward in Ananth et. al. (Eurocrypt' 21). This problem aims to leverage unclonable nature of quantum information to allow a lessor to lease a quantum key with reusability for evaluating a classical functionality. Later, the lessor can request the lessee to provably delete the key and then the lessee will be completely deprived of the capability to evaluate. In this work, we construct a secure key leasing scheme to lease a decryption key of a (classical) public-key, homomorphic encryption scheme from standard lattice assumptions. Our encryption scheme is exactly identical to the (primal) version of Gentry-Sahai-Waters homomorphic encryption scheme with a carefully chosen public key matrix. We achieve strong form of security where: The entire protocol (including key generation and verification of deletion) uses merely classical communication between a classical lessor (client) and a quantum lessee (server). Assuming standard assumptions, our security definition ensures that every computationally bounded quantum adversary could only simultaneously provide a valid classical deletion certificate and yet distinguish ciphertexts with at most some negligible probability. Our security relies on subexponential time hardness of learning with errors assumption. Our scheme is the first scheme to be based on a standard assumption and satisfying the two properties mentioned above. The main technical novelty in our work is the design of an FHE scheme that enables us to apply elegant analyses done in the context of classical verification of quantumness from LWE (Brakerski et. al.(FOCS'18, JACM'21) and its parallel amplified version in Radian et. al.(AFT'21)) to the setting of secure leasing. This connection to classical verification of quantumness leads to a modular construction and arguably simpler proofs than previously known. An important technical component we prove along the way is an amplified quantum search-to-decision reduction: we design an extractor that uses a quantum distinguisher (who has an internal quantum state) for decisional LWE, to extract secrets with success probability amplified to almost one. This technique might be of independent interest.","Orestis Chardouvelis (Carnegie Mellon University); Vipul Goyal (NTT Research, Carnegie Mellon University); Aayush Jain (Carnegie Mellon University); Jiahui Liu (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)",2024,0.8208,0.0908537,0.0883462,1,0.206535,0,0.519959,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.229881,0,0,0,0,0.206535,0.229881,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.156999,0,0,0,0,0.536063,0,0,0,0,0.25998,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25998,0.302401,0,0,0,0,0,0.999999557
23,Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution Across National Scale Telecommunication Infrastructure,Twin Field QKD over Existing Infrastructure,- Implementation of Twin Field QKD over 254 km link - Integrated into standard telecommunication infrastructure - Achieves 110 bit/s rate,"Quantum Communications (QC) harness quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to enhance information transfer between remote nodes. Coherent quantum communications refer to QC schemes relying on maintaining optical coherence between nodes for successful execution. These schemes typically involve single photon interference between optical fields generated by distant parties and represent a cornerstone of a promising architecture of the quantum internet. Despite their significant potential, scientific and technical hurdles - including optical coherence maintenance, integrating high-performance single-photon detectors, and precise stabilisation and synchronisation - have prevented the implementation of coherent QC over existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here we present the first realisation of a coherent QC fully integrated into standard telecommunication infrastructure over a link connecting the German cities of Frankfurt and Kehl. The implemented scheme is the Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, enabling the distribution of a shared secret key for encryption at a rate of 110 bit/s over a highly asymmetric 254 km link. This result, obtained with a system featuring measurement-device-independent properties, marks the longest installed QKD implementation utilising non-cryogenic cooled detectors and was enabled by the QC system architecture we developed and by our approach to phase stabilisation, which involves active out-of-band phase stabilisation and avalanche photodiodes for single photon detection.

24,The Quantum Decoherence Model: Everlasting Commitments and Quantum Incompressible Encryption,Quantum Decoherence Model,#NAME?,"Quantum cryptography allows to achieve security goals that are unobtainable using classical cryptography alone, it offers the promise of everlasting privacy. That is, an adversary trying to attack a protocol must succeed during the run of the protocol, after the protocol has terminated security holds unconditionally. In this work we initiate the study of a new model which we call the quantum decoherence model (QDM). In a nutshell, this model requires that the adversary is computationally bounded during the run of a protocol (and some time after), but becomes computationally unbounded long after the protocol terminates. Importantly, once the adversary becomes computationally unbounded, he can only remember a bounded number of qubits from before the bound was lifted. As our main contribution, we construct a non-interactive commitment scheme achieving unconditional security against malicious senders and everlasting security against malicious receivers in the UC model. Additionally, we show that it gives rise to everlasting public key encryption and OT in the QDM. Finally, we also consider the weaker notion of incompressible encryption in the setting of quantum decoherence, and show that post-quantum IND-CPA secure public key encryption is sufficient to realize this notion without resorting to random oracles.","Anne Müller (CISPA - Helmholtz Center for Information Security); Nico Döttling (CISPA - Helmholtz Center for Information Security); Sven Maier (KASTEL Security Research Labs, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology); Marcel Tiepelt (KASTEL Security Research Labs, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology); Alexander Koch (CNRS, IRIF, Université Paris Cité); Jörn Müller-Quade (KASTEL Security Research Labs, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)",2024,0.719051,0.140055,0.140895,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.158661,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.212879,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.638638,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.722254,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.000000059

26,Quantum One-Wayness of the Single-Round Sponge with Invertible Permutations,Quantum Security of Sponge Functions,"Proves the “double-sided zero-search” conjecture by Unruh, establishing query bounds. Introduces a novel “symmetrization argument” using Young subgroups. Shows quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible permutations.","Sponge hashing is a widely used class of cryptographic hash algorithms which underlies the current international hash function standard SHA-3. In a nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a digest by once again iterating the block function on the final output bits. While much is known about the post-quantum security of the sponge construction in the case when the block function is modeled as a random function or one-way permutation, the case of permutations allowing inverse queries, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3, has so far remained a fundamental open problem. In this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show several results. First, we prove the “double-sided zero-search” conjecture proposed by Unruh (eprint’ 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random 2n-bit permutation requires at least Ω(2^n/2) many queries—and this is tight due to Grover’s algorithm. At the core of our proof lies a novel “symmetrization argument” which uses insights from the theory of Young subgroups. Second, we consider more general variants of the double-sided search problem and show similar query lower bounds for them. As an application, we prove the quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible permutations in the quantum random permutation model.",Joseph Carolan (University of Maryland); Alexander Poremba (MIT),2024,0.104629,0.101636,0.793734,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.329029,0,0,0,0,0.245228,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.245228,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.372108,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.112356,0,0,0.658058,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.432826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.000000269

Includes bounds on Rényi mutual information and smooth max-information. Applies results to device-dependent and device-independent protocols.,"In this work we derive a number of chain rules for mutual information quantities, suitable for analyzing quantum cryptography with imperfect devices that leak additional information to an adversary. First, we derive a chain rule between smooth min-entropy and smooth max-information, which improves over previous chain rules for characterizing one-shot information leakage caused by an additional conditioning register. Second, we derive an information accumulation theorem that bounds the Rényi mutual information of a state produced by a sequence of channels, in terms of the Rényi mutual information of the individual channel outputs. In particular, this yields simple bounds on the smooth max-information in the preceding chain rule. Third, we derive chain rules between Rényi entropies and Rényi mutual information, which can be used to modify the entropy accumulation theorem to accommodate leakage registers sent to the adversary in each round of a protocol. We show that these results can be used to handle some device imperfections in a variety of device-dependent and device-independent protocols, such as randomness generation and quantum key distribution.","Amir Arqand (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo); Tony Metger (Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH Zurich); and Ernest Y.-Z.

Demonstrates device-independent verification of a four-photon GHZ state using a high-fidelity photon source.,"Authentication of quantum resources is a critical tool in the development of quantum information processing protocols. In particular, the verification of quantum states is often used as a building block for communication tasks, determining whether the communicating parties can trust the resources at hand to exchange information or whether the protocol should be aborted. Self-testing methods have been used to tackle such verification tasks in a device-independent (DI) scenario. However, these approaches commonly consider the limit of large, identically and independently distributed (IID) samples, which weakens the DI claim and poses serious challenges to their experimental implementation. To address these issues, Gocanin et al. [1] developed a protocol to certify quantum states in the few-copies and non-IID regime. In this work, we adopt their protocol to experimentally demonstrate the device-independent verification of a four-photon GHZ state, produced with our compact and high-fidelity multipartite entangled photon source.",Laura dos Santos Martins (LIP6 - Sorbonne Université); Nicolas Laurent-Puig (LIP6 - Sorbonne Université); Ivan Šupić (LIP6 - Sorbonne Université); Pascal Lefebvre (LIP6 - Sorbonne Université); Damian Markham (LIP6 - Sorbonne Université); and Eleni Diamanti (LIP6 - Sorbonne Université),2024,0.0986335,0.804899,0.0964677,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.0870129,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.506394,0,0,0.149256,0,0,0,0.506394,0,0,0,0,0,0.222483,0,0,0.09417,0,0,0,0.37668,0,0,0.447768,0,0.134098,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.196341,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.000000553
29,Unconditionally Secure Commitments with Quantum Auxiliary Inputs,Quantum Commitments,Proves the existence of computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input commitments without relying on unproven assumptions. Introduces the CRQS model for statistically hiding and binding commitments.,"We show the following unconditional results on quantum commitments in two related yet different models: 1. We revisit the notion of quantum auxiliary-input commitments introduced by Chailloux, Kerenidis, and Rosgen (Comput. Complex. 2016) where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state, which is determined by the security parameter, as quantum auxiliary inputs. We show that computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input commitments exist unconditionally, i.e., without relying on any unproven assumption, while Chailloux et al. assumed a complexity-theoretic assumption, $QIP not subseteq QMA$. On the other hand, we observe that achieving both statistical hiding and statistical binding at the same time is impossible even in the quantum auxiliary-input setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of unconditionally proving computational security of any form of (classical or quantum) commitments for which statistical security is impossible. As intermediate steps toward our construction, we introduce and unconditionally construct post-quantum sparse pseudorandom distributions and quantum auxiliary-input EFI pairs which may be of independent interest. 2. We introduce a new model which we call the common reference quantum state (CRQS) model where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state that is randomly sampled by an efficient setup algorithm. We unconditionally prove that there exist statistically hiding and statistically binding commitments in the CRQS model, circumventing the impossibility in the plain model. We also discuss their applications to zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious transfers, and multi-party computations.","Tomoyuki Morimae (Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan); Barak Nehoran (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ); and Takashi Yamakawa (NTT Social Informatics Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan)",2024,0.762697,0.116356,0.120947,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.220005,0,0,0,0.144988,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.255903,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.194534,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0664293,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.220005,0,0.880018,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.000000137

Demonstrates that O(n/log(n))-copy OWSGs are the weakest from which commitments can be derived. Provides a simpler alternative construction compared to classical pseudorandom generators.,"One-way state generators (OWSG) [MY22a] are natural quantum analogs to classical one-way functions. We show that O(n/log(n))-copy OWSGs (n represents the input length) are equivalent to poly(n)-copy OWSGs and to quantum commitments. Since known results show that o(n/log(n))-copy OWSGs cannot imply commitments [CGG`23], this shows that O(n/log(n))-copy OWSGs are the weakest OWSGs from which we can get commitments (and hence much of quantum cryptography). Our construction follows along the lines of Håstad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby [HILL99], who obtained classical pseudorandom generators (PRG) from classical one-way functions (OWF), however with crucial modifications. Our construction, when applied to the classical case, provides an alternative to the construction provided by [HILL99].

Improves postselection technique and decoy-state analysis with one decoy intensity. Provides a full security proof for generic decoy-state protocols.,"Proving the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols against arbitrary attacks is a challenging task for arbitrary protocols. Here, we accomplish this task by extending and improving both the decoy-state analysis against collective attacks, and the postselection technique to uplift this security proof to arbitrary attacks. First, we improve the postselection technique - both by improving the cost paid for the uplift, and by rigorously showing how it can be applied to generic optical protocols. Second, we fundamentally improve the decoy-state analysis in such a way that we require only one decoy intensity to achieve the same performance as prior analysis with two decoy intensities. This has two consequences - it makes the protocol easier to practically implement, and reduces the penalty incurred by using the postselection technique. Third, we extend the finite-size QKD analysis to decoy-state protocols and generically improve the finite-size correction terms that appear. Thus, we provide a full security proof against arbitrary attacks for generic decoy-state protocols.","Shlok Nahar (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo); Lars Kamin (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo); Devashish Tupkary (Institute for Quantum Computing); Yuming Zhao (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Waterloo); Ernest Y.-Z.

Applies a general transformation for quantum nonlocal games. Analyzes soundness of the transformation in the context of Pauli measurements.,"We construct a succinct classical argument system for QMA, the quantum analogue of NP, from generic and standard cryptographic assumptions. Previously, building on the prior work of Mahadev (FOCS '18), Bartusek et al. (CRYPTO '22) also constructed a succinct classical argument system for QMA. However, their construction relied on post-quantumly secure indistinguishability obfuscation, a very strong primitive which is not known from standard cryptographic assumptions. In contrast, the primitives we use (namely, collapsing hash functions and a mild version of quantum homomorphic encryption) are much weaker and are implied by standard assumptions such as LWE. Our protocol is constructed using a general transformation which was designed by Kalai et al. (STOC '23) as a candidate method to compile any quantum nonlocal game into an argument system.

33,Simple constructions of linear-depth t-designs and pseudorandom unitaries,Efficient Random Unitaries,Introduces the PFC ensemble for constructing t-designs and pseudorandom unitaries. Provides the first construction of linear-depth t-designs and non-adaptive PRUs. Demonstrates adaptive pseudorandom isometries and their applications.,"Uniformly random unitaries, i.e. unitaries drawn from the Haar measure, have many useful properties but cannot be implemented efficiently. This has motivated a long line of research into random unitaries that ``look'' sufficiently Haar random while also being efficient to implement. Two different notions of derandomisation have emerged: t-designs are random unitaries that information-theoretically reproduce the first t moments of the Haar measure, and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) are random unitaries that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar random.In this work, we take a unified approach to constructing t-designs and PRUs. For this, we introduce and analyse the ``PFC ensemble'', the product of a computational basis permutation P, a random binary phase operator F, and a random Clifford unitary C. We show that this ensemble reproduces exponentially high moments of the Haar measure. We can then derandomise the PFC ensemble to show the following:-Linear-depth t-designs. We give the first construction of a (diamond-error) approximate t-design with circuit depth linear in t. This follows from the PFC ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their 2t-wise independent counterparts. - Non-adaptive PRUs. We give the first construction of PRUs with non-adaptive security, i.e. we construct unitaries that are indistinguishable from Haar random to polynomial-time distinguishers that query the unitary in parallel on an arbitary state. This follows from the PFC ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their pseudorandom counterparts. - Adaptive pseudorandom isometries. We show that if one considers isometries (rather than unitaries) from n to n + \omega(log n) qubits, a small modification of our PRU construction achieves adaptive security, i.e.~even a distinguisher that can query the isometry adaptively in sequence cannot distinguish it from Haar random isometries. This gives the first construction of adaptive pseudorandom isometries.

In a first laboratory experiment, we applied the security statement of a recently published security proof to calculate composable key rates with a total security parameter of ε = 1e-10 in the finite size regime against i.i.d. collective attacks. We also used the post-processing pipeline to study the effect of error correction and frame errors on the actual key extraction in a finite-size system – finding that the common approach of going to high frame errors to increase the ECC efficiency β does not optimize the extractable key length.Furthermore, we deployed the system over an ad-hoc atmospheric channel of 1.7 km in Mai 2023 in the city of Jena, Germany. In a first proof-of-principle study, we were able to apply the full optical and post-processing pipeline to extract pseudo-asymptotic keys and discuss the further steps necessary to move the system to the finite-size regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CVQKD demonstration over a real atmospheric channel combining both the new class of DMCVQKD security proofs without Gaussian optimality and error correction steps.","Kevin Jaksch (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Thomas Dirmeier (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Jan Schreck (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Yannick Weiser (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Stefan Richter (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Ömer Bayraktar (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Bastian Hacker (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Conrad Rößler (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Imran Khan (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); Andrej Krzic (Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Jena, Germany); Markus Rothe (Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Jena, Germany); Markus Leipe (Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Jena, Germany); Nico Döll (Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Jena, Germany); Christopher Spiess (Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Jena, Germany); Matthias Goy (Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Jena, Germany); Stefan Petscharning (Austrian Institute of Technology, Center for Digital Safety&Security, Vienna, Austria); Thomas Grafenauer (Austrian Institute of Technology, Center for Digital Safety&Security, Vienna, Austria); Bernhard Ömer (Austrian Institute of Technology, Center for Digital Safety&Security, Vienna, Austria); Christoph Pacher (Austrian Institute of Technology, Center for Digital Safety&Security, Vienna, Austria); Florian Kanitschar (Austrian Institute of Technology, Center for Digital Safety&Security, Vienna, Austria); Twesh Upadhyaya (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Canada); Jie Lin (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Canada); Norbert Lütkenhaus (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Canada); Gerd Leuchs (Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany); and Christoph Marquardt (Department of Physics, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany)",2024,0.81985,0.0885367,0.0916135,1,0,0.174329,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.197154,0.174329,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.174329,0,0.156625,0.174329,0,0.687971,0,0,0,0,0.229324,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0749341,0,0,0,0.0595296,0,0.313249,0,0,0.10163,0.156625,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.197154,0,0,0,0,0.197154,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.197154,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.174329,1.00000033
